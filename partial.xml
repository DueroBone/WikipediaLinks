'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that seeks to abolish all institutions that perpetuate [[authority]], coercion, or [[Social hierarchy|hierarchy]], primarily targeting the [[state (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fiala |first=Andrew |title=Anarchism |date=2021 |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anarchism/ |access-date=2025-02-23 |edition=Winter 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with [[Stateless society|stateless societies]] and voluntary [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]]. A historically left-wing movement, anarchism is usually described as the [[libertarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]] ([[libertarian socialism]]).

Although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout [[history]], modern anarchism emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in [[Labour movement|workers' struggles]] for [[emancipation]]. [[#Schools of thought|Various anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in [[List of revolutions and rebellions|several revolutions]], most notably in the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose conclusion marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more, growing in popularity and influence within [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-war]] and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.

Anarchists employ [[diversity of tactics|diverse approaches]], which may be generally divided into [[revolutionary]] and [[evolutionary strategies]]; there is significant overlap between the two. Evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like, but revolutionary tactics, which have historically taken a [[Violent extremism|violent]] turn, aim to overthrow authority and the state. Many facets of [[Civilization|human civilization]] have been influenced by anarchist theory, critique, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].

{{See also|Glossary of anarchism}}
[[File:Proudhon_jeune.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] – the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist{{Sfn|Kahn|2000}}&lt;ref name = &quot;Merriman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Leier&quot;/&gt;]]
The [[Etymology|etymological]] origin of ''anarchism'' is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''anarkhia'' (ἀναρχία), meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the [[prefix]] ''an-'' (&quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (&quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The [[suffix]] ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy.{{Sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642 as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder.{{Sfnm|1a1=Merriam-Webster|1y=2019|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=''Oxford English Dictionary''|2y=2005|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|3a1=Sylvan|3y=2007|3p=260}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{Sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}{{Sfn|Carlson|1972|pp=22–23}}

The first [[List of political philosophers|political philosopher]] to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{Langx|fr|link=no|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865),{{Sfn|Kahn|2000}}&lt;ref name = &quot;Merriman&quot;&gt;Merriman, John M. (2009). ''How a Bombing in Fin-de-Siècle Paris Ignited the Age of Modern Terror''. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 42. {{ISBN|9780300217933}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Leier&quot;&gt;Leier, Mark (2006). ''Bakunin: The Creative Passion''. New York: Seven Stories Press. p. 211. {{ISBN|9781583228944}}.&lt;/ref&gt; marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{Sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism;{{Sfn|Guérin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{Sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} Some usages of ''libertarianism'' refer to [[individualistic]] [[free-market]] philosophy only, and [[free-market anarchism]] in particular is termed ''libertarian anarchism''.{{Sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While the term ''libertarian'' has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6}} its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups,{{Sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} including both the [[New Left]] and [[libertarian Marxists]], who do not associate themselves with [[authoritarian socialists]] or a [[vanguard party]], and extreme [[cultural liberals]], who are primarily concerned with [[civil liberties]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} Additionally, some anarchists use ''[[libertarian socialist]]''{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6|3a1=Levy|3a2=Adams|3y=2018|3p=104}} to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with [[socialism]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} ''Anarchism'' is broadly used to describe the [[anti-authoritarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]].{{Sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=104}}{{Refn|In ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (1970),{{Sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} anarchist historian [[Daniel Guérin]] described it as a synonym for [[libertarian socialism]], and wrote that anarchism &quot;is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.&quot;{{Sfn|Arvidsson|2017}} In his many works on anarchism, historian [[Noam Chomsky]] describes anarchism, alongside [[libertarian Marxism]], as the [[libertarian]] wing of [[socialism]].{{Sfn|Otero|1994|p=617}}|group=nb}} Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are [[State socialism|state-oriented]] or from above.{{Sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials{{Sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two.{{Sfn|Morris|2015|p=64}} Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism,{{Sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} and being both liberal and socialist but more so.{{Sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Many scholars reject [[anarcho-capitalism]] as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles.{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morris|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}{{Refn|[[Herbert L. Osgood]] claimed that anarchism is &quot;the extreme antithesis&quot; of [[authoritarian communism]] and [[state socialism]].{{Sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} [[Peter Marshall (author, born 1946)|Peter Marshall]] states that &quot;[i]n general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ... Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. It cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine.&quot;{{Sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} According to [[Jeremy Jennings]], &quot;[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas&quot;, referring to [[anarcho-capitalism]], &quot;are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is.&quot; Jennings adds that &quot;anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the 'anarcho-capitalists' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community.&quot;{{Sfn|Jennings|1999|p=147}} [[Nicolas Walter]] wrote that &quot;anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically. ... In a sense, anarchists always remain liberals and socialists, and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself. ... We are liberals but more so, and socialists but more so.&quot;{{Sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many [[socialist traditions]], especially the more socialist-aligned tradition following Proudhon and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{Sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]] argues that it is &quot;conceptually and historically misleading&quot; to &quot;create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism.&quot;{{Sfn|Morris|2015|p=64}}|group=nb}}

While [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining ''anarchism'' is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{Sfn|Long|2013|p=217}}{{Refn|One common definition adopted by anarchists is that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organisation]], including [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and all associated institutions, in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[decentralisation]], [[freedom]], and [[voluntary association]]. Scholars highlight that this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on anti-authoritarianism (''[[a posteriori]]'' conclusion), anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that),{{Sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1p=166|2a1=Jun|2y=2009|2p=507|3a1=Franks|3y=2013|3pp=386–388}} and etymology (negation of rulers).{{Sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}}|group=nb}} Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that [[human nature]] allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society, and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.{{Sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of anarchism}}

=== Pre-modern era ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] ({{Circa|334|262 BC}}), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in [[History of China#Ancient China|China]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophers [[Zhuang Zhou]] and [[Laozi]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Alongside [[Stoicism]], Taoism has been said to have had &quot;significant anticipations&quot; of anarchism.{{Sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=257}}

Anarchic attitudes were also articulated by [[Tragedy|tragedians]] and [[Philosophy|philosophers]] in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between laws imposed by the state and personal [[autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned [[Athens|Athenian]] authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual [[freedom of conscience]]. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''[[physis]]''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements. These, and other Muslim movements, later gave birth to [[Anarchism and religion|religious anarchism]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarian]] society and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by Emperor [[Kavad I]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}} In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state.{{Sfn|Crone|2000|pp=3, 21–25}} In Europe, various religious sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies.{{Sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=8}}

Renewed interest in antiquity during the [[Renaissance]] and in private judgment during the [[Reformation]] restored elements of anti-authoritarian [[secularism]] in Europe, particularly in France.{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=108}} [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] challenges to intellectual authority (secular and religious) and the [[List of revolutions and rebellions|revolutions of the 1790s and 1848]] all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism.{{Sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=307}}

=== Modern era ===
[[File:Barricade18March1871 (more cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Paris Commune]] one of the earliest experiments of anarchism]]
During the [[French Revolution]], partisan groups such as the [[Enragés]] and the {{Lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 19th century as [[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] [[Anarchism in the United Kingdom|in England]], morally delegitimising the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil [[Anarchism in France|in France]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} By the late 1870s, various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined and a wave of then-unprecedented [[globalisation]] occurred from 1880 to 1914.{{Sfn|Levy|2011|pp=10–15}} This era of [[classical anarchism]] lasted until the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.]]
Drawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class [[Working class|worker]] [[Trade union|union]] later known as the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with [[Karl Marx]] being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction (the [[Jura Federation]]) and Proudhon's followers (the mutualists) opposed [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{Sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the [[Marxists]] at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Anarchists were treated similarly in the [[Second International]], being ultimately expelled in 1896.{{Sfn|Levy|2011|p=12}} Bakunin predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx's terms, they would end up the [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|new tyrants of workers]]. In response to their expulsion from the First International, anarchists formed the [[St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|according to one's needs]].{{Sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}

During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]], known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to [[Penal colony|penal colonies]] following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{Sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to prevent [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchists immigrating to the US]], including the ''[[Immigration Act of 1903]]'', also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act.{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=633–636|2a1=Lutz|2a2=Ulmschneider|2y=2019|2p=46}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.{{Sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

By the turn of the 20th century, the terrorist movement had died down, giving way to [[anarchist communism]] and [[syndicalism]], while anarchism had spread all over the world.{{Sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}}{{Sfn|Levy|2011|p=16}} In [[Anarchism in China|China]], small groups of students imported the [[Humanism|humanistic]] pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} [[Anarchism in Japan|Tokyo]] was a hotspot for [[rebellion|rebellious]] youth from East Asian countries, who moved to the Japanese capital to study.{{Sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In Latin America, [[Anarchism in Argentina|Argentina]] was a stronghold for [[anarcho-syndicalism]], where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{Sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} Anarchists were involved in the [[Strandzha Commune]] and [[Krusevo Republic]] established in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in [[Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising]] of 1903, and in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. The [[Revolutions of 1917–1923|revolutionary wave of 1917–23]] saw varying degrees of active participation by anarchists.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=470}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|right|Nestor Makhno seen with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine]]]]
Despite concerns, [[Anarchism in Russia|anarchists]] enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]] in opposition to the [[White movement]], especially in the [[Makhnovshchina]]. Seeing the victories of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[Communist parties]], which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements such as the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{Sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}} However, anarchists met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] had stabilised, including during the [[Kronstadt rebellion]].{{Sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine, before the Bolsheviks crushed the [[Anarchism in Ukraine|anarchist movement there]] too.{{Sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} With the anarchists being repressed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party.

In the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–39, anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war, and particularly in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936]]. In response to the army [[rebellion]], an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired movement]] of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain, where they [[collectivised]] the land.{{Sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The [[Soviet Union]] provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight between communists and other leftists in a series of events known as the [[May Days]], as [[Joseph Stalin]] asserted Soviet control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government, ending in another defeat of anarchists at the hands of the communists.{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

By the end of [[World War II]], the anarchist movement had been severely weakened.{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]], and [[peace movement]]s, the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[New Left]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative [[anti-capitalist reform]]ism.{{Sfn|Levy|2011|pp=5|p=}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]] as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} The established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}} [[Black anarchism]] began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism's move from a [[Eurocentric]] demographic.{{Sfn|Williams|2015|p=680}} This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America.{{Sfn|Harmon|2011|p=70}}

[[File:Anarchists at WTO protest (14988709689).jpg|thumbnail|[[Black bloc]] organizing during the [[Battle of Seattle]]]]
Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist, [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.{{Sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalisation movement,{{Sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{Sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. During the [[protest]]s, ''ad hoc'' [[Leaderless resistance|leaderless]] anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in rioting, [[property destruction]] and [[Violence|violent]] confrontations with the police. Other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include [[affinity group]]s, [[security culture]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO conference]].{{Sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{Sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Contemporary news coverage of [[black bloc]] demonstrations emphasizes violence committed by anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2013-10-08 |title=Black Blocs hijack Brazil teacher protests |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24453113 |access-date=2025-06-23 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Booth |first=Robert |last2=Vallée |first2=Marc |date=2011-04-01 |title='Black bloc' anarchists behind anti-cuts rampage reject thuggery claims |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/01/anarchists-anti-cuts-march |access-date=2025-06-23 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2011-04-03 |title=Who are the Black Bloc and what are they trying to achieve? |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-04-04/blocwilliams/45890 |access-date=2025-06-23 |work=ABC News |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While having revolutionary aspirations, many contemporary forms of anarchism are not confrontational. Instead, they are trying to build an alternative way of [[social organization]] (following the theories of [[dual power]]), based on [[Mutual aid|mutual interdependence]] and voluntary cooperation, for instance in groups such as [[Food Not Bombs]] and in [[self-managed social centers]].{{Sfn|Honeywell|2021|}}

Anarchism's publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as [[anthropology]] and [[Historian|history]] to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over [[Academy|academic]] theory.{{Sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Evren|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Angelbeck|3a2=Grier|3y=2012|3p=549}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]] and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria|Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern [[Anarchism in Syria|Syria]].{{Sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

== Schools of thought &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;Branches&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ==
Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, [[Value (ethics and social sciences)|values]] and evolution.{{Sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} The individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and [[social ownership]].{{Sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents ([[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]], and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{Sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=9}}

[[File:Black bloc at RNC running.jpg|thumb|Black bloc protesters parading anarcho-communism imagery such as the motto &quot;[[No War but the Class War]]&quot;]]
Anarchism's emphasis on [[anti-capitalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and for the extension of community and [[individual]]ity sets it apart from anarcho-capitalism and other types of [[economic libertarian]]ism.{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morris|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}} Anarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum, though many reject state authority from conservative principles, such as [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gHyUj9HFYBIC&amp;pg=PP15 xi]|1ps=, &quot;Usually considered to be an extreme left-wing ideology&quot;.}} Much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]], [[libertarian]], and [[Radical politics|radical]] interpretations of left-wing and [[socialist]] politics{{Sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} such as [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[anarchist communism|communism]], [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{Sfn|Guérin|1970|p=35|loc=&quot;Critique of authoritarian socialism&quot;}}

As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of [[doctrine]] from a single particular [[worldview]],{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{Sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} One reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for [[toleration]] and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{Sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of shared principles such as autonomy, [[mutual aid]], [[anti-authoritarianism]] and [[Decentralization|decentralisation]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=1–6|2a1=Angelbeck|2a2=Grier|2y=2012|2p=551}}

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist political movements which constitute political anarchism lies [[philosophical anarchism]], which holds that the state lacks [[Legitimacy (political)|moral legitimacy]], without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{Sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=2}} A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{Sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2003|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]] but claims that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual [[autonomy]].{{Sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} Philosophical currents as diverse as [[Objectivism]] and [[Kantianism]] have provided arguments drawn on in favor of philosophical anarchism, including [[Robert Paul Wolff|Wolff's]] defense of anarchism against formal methods for legitimating it.&lt;ref name=sa&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Thomas |date=Fall–Winter 2000 |title=Book Review: In Defense of Anarchism |journal=[[Social Anarchism (journal)|Social Anarchism]] |issue=27 |url=http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/348 |access-date=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy.{{Sfn|Franks|2019|p=549}} Belief in political [[nihilism]] has been espoused by anarchists.{{Sfn|Walter|2002|p=52}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is the primary proponent of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and influenced many future [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchist]] thinkers.{{Sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=216–218}}]]
{{Main|Individualist anarchism|Mutualism (economic theory)|Collectivist anarchism|Anarchist communism|Anarcho-syndicalism}}

Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]]. They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism ([[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[anarchist communism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). They differ on [[Organization|organisational]] and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{Sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=2}}

Mutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Its aims include &quot;abolishing the state&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Desk Encyclopedia of World History |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-7394-7809-7 |editor-last=Wright |editor-first=Edmund |location=New York |pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary contract, federation and [[monetary reform]] of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{Sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=213–218}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{Sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} In ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;{{Sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187}} Collectivist anarchism is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism{{Sfn|Morris|1993|p=76}} commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{Sfn|Shannon|2019|p=101}} Collectivist anarchists advocate [[collective ownership]] of the [[means of production]] which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution{{Sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside [[Marxism]] but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990}}

Anarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{Sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} held by a [[federalism|federal]] network of [[voluntary association]]s,{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=327}} with production and consumption based on the guiding principle &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].&quot;{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–238}} Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]]{{Sfn|Graham|2005}} but was first formulated as such in the [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian]] section of the [[First International]].{{Sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]],{{Sfn|Turcato|2019|pp=239–244}} whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century.{{Sfn|Levy|2011|p=6}} Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are [[direct action]], workers' [[solidarity]] and [[workers' self-management]].{{Sfn|Van der Walt|2019|p=249}}

Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{Sfn|Ryley|2019|p=225}} Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

=== Post-classical and contemporary ===
{{Main|Contemporary anarchism}}
[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|Lawrence Jarach (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right) are two prominent contemporary anarchist authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and Jarach a notable advocate of [[post-left anarchy]].]]
Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[syncretic|combining disparate concepts]] to create new philosophical approaches.{{Sfn|Williams|2007|p=303}}The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent in contemporary currents.{{Sfn|Williams|2018|p=4}}

Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement.{{Sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385–386}} While theorists and activists have established &quot;relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles&quot;, there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple ''anarchisms'', rather than a singular ''anarchism'', in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. [[Gender equality]] can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarcho-communists.{{Sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}

Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely &quot;all centralized and [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, [[Bolshevism]], [[feudalism]], [[slavery]], etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist Islam]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], etc.), [[patriarchy]], [[heterosexism]], [[white supremacy]], and [[imperialism]].&quot;{{Sfn|Jun|2009|pp=507–508}} Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{Sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}}

== Tactics ==
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals, namely, to first oppose [[the Establishment]] and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|unity of means and ends]].{{Sfn|Williams|2019|pp=107–108}} A broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other.{{Sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Evolutionary tactics embrace [[nonviolence]] and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, although there is significant overlap between the two.{{Sfn|Kinna|2019|p=125}}

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a [[Diversity of tactics|broader array of approaches]].{{Sfn|Williams|2019|p=112}}

=== Classical era ===
[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|right|The relationship between [[anarchism and violence]] is a controversial subject among anarchists as shown by anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]] [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinating]] [[William McKinley]].]]
During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed terrorism as [[propaganda of the deed]]. Assassination attempts were carried out against [[Head of state|heads of state]], some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in revolutions.{{Sfn|Williams|2019|pp=112–113}} Many anarchists, especially the [[Galleanists]], believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state.{{Sfn|Norris|2020|pp=7–8}} Many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s, the early 1880s and the 1890s, with some still occurring in the early 1900s.{{Sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=13|2a1=Nesser|2y=2012|2p=62}} Their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and of targeting and cataloging by state institutions.{{Sfn|Harmon|2011|p=55}}

Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial.{{Sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} [[Anarcho-pacifism|Anarcho-pacifists]] advocate for non-violence means to achieve their stateless, nonviolent ends.{{Sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=section 3.1}} Other anarchist groups advocate [[direct action]], a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or [[terrorism]]. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a [[tyrant]] and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible.{{Sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=116–117}} [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{Sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

Anarchists took an active role in strike actions, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as [[reformist]]. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism.{{Sfn|Williams|2019|p=113}} Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda [[Anarchism and the arts|within the arts]], some of whom practiced [[naturism]] and [[nudism]]. Those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media.{{Sfn|Williams|2019|p=114}}

In the current era, [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchist]] [[Alfredo Bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group [[The Invisible Committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression using [[sabotage]] and other violent means against state, capitalism, and other enemies. [[Tarnac Nine|Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008]] on various charges, terrorism included.{{Sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=134–135}}

Overall, contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries such as [[Anarchism in Canada|Canada]], [[Anarchism in Greece|Greece]], and [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]]. Militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police;{{Sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against [[Fascism|fascists]], [[Racism|racists]], and [[Bigot|other bigots]], taking [[anti-fascist]] action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{Sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}}

=== Evolutionary ===
[[File:Free Soup For the Revolution.jpg|thumb|[[Food not Bombs]] poster with a [[circle A]] with thext reading &quot;Free Soup for the Revolution&quot;]]
Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as [[Intentional community|communes]] and non-hierarchical collectives.{{Sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having [[Group decision-making|equal say in each decision]], an approach known as [[horizontalidad|horizontalism]].{{Sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the &quot;big-A Anarchism&quot; of the classical era, the newly coined term &quot;small-a anarchism&quot; signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience, which they will later theorize.{{Sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}

The concept of [[prefigurative politics]] is enacted by many contemporary anarchist groups, striving to embody the principles, organization and tactics of the changed social structure they hope to bring about. As part of this the decision-making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role.{{Sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of [[facilitator]] to help achieve a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]] as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{Sfn|Williams|2019|pp=119–121}}

As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone online to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{Sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118–119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these [[Hacktivism|hacktivists]] work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from [[Mass surveillance|state surveillance]].{{Sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120–121}}

Anarchists organize themselves to [[Squatting|squat]] and reclaim [[public space]]s. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and [[surrealism]] are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{Sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, [[squatting]] is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action.{{Sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{Sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque]] atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{Sfn|Morland|2004|pp=37–38}}

&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, these overview summaries are meant to be brief. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought, disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and [[Tactic (method)|tactics]] is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Marxism]], and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism), and the [[Anarchism and statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{Sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== The state ===
&lt;!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --&gt;[[File:Fight_the_state,_not_wars.jpg|thumb|Anarchist protesters in [[Boston]] opposing state-waged war]]
Objection to the [[State (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{Sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=Jun|2y=2019|2pp=29–30}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{Sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}

Specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. [[Robert Paul Wolff]] believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning &quot;coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be.&quot; [[A. John Simmons]] and [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.{{Sfnm|1a1=Wendt|1y=2020|1p=2|2a1=Ashwood|2y=2018|2p=727}} Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.{{Sfn|Ashwood|2018|p=735}}

=== Gender, sexuality, and free love ===
{{Main|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex}}
As [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, many anarchists address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy imposed by gender roles.{{Sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

[[File:AnarchaFeminism.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Collection of [[anarcha-feminist]] protests, symbols, and flags]]
Sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing.{{Sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], who opposed [[age-of-consent laws]], believing they would benefit predatory men.{{Sfn|Lucy|2020|p=178}} A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]], [[relationship anarchy]], and [[queer anarchism]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{Sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together.{{Sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{Sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and [[Abortion-rights movement|pro-choice]] (using a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[Women's suffrage|suffrage]] but were supportive of one another.{{Sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=166–167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second wave of feminism]], radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, LGBT people, and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{Sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and [[compulsory heterosexuality]] became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a [[post-structuralist]] critique of [[Heteronormativity|sexual normality]].{{Sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.{{Sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as William Godwin (''[[Political Justice]]'') and Max Stirner (&quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;) attacked both [[State school|state education]] and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{Sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222}}

In 1901, [[Catalonia|Catalan]] anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{Sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process while giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{Sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]], who published the essay ''Education and Culture'', also established a similar school with its founding principle being that &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free.&quot;{{Sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518}} In a similar token, [[A. S. Neill]] founded what became the [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{Sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}

Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes [[Manipulation (psychology)|manipulation]]. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and [[social justice]] were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.{{Sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1980|1pp=3–33|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=519–522}}

Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ([[Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Colin Ward]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of [[State school|state education]], largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism]] as part of a consumer society.{{Sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate [[Economic inequality|socioeconomic inequality]].{{Sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39–48}}

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for [[Children's rights movement|child autonomy]] and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists' schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in [[Brighton|Brighton, England]], and the Paideia School in Spain.{{Sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526}}

=== The arts ===
{{Main|Anarchism and the arts}}
[[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|''Les chataigniers a Osny'' (1888) by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]] is a notable example of blending anarchism and the arts.{{Sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}]]
The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.{{Sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{Sfn|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as [[Punk subculture|punk]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=493–494|2a1=Dunn|2y=2012|3a1=Evren|3a2=Kinna|3a3=Rouselle|3y=2013|p=138}} Anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Herbert Read]] stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{Sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592–593}}

Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{Sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book ''Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas'', Chris Robé claims that &quot;anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.&quot;{{Sfn|Robé|2017|p=44}} Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists ([[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Camillo Berneri]]) and publications such as ''[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]'' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{Sfn|Miller|Dirlik|Rosemont|Augustyn|2019|p=1}}

Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect.{{Sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593–596}} The 19th-century [[neo-impressionist]] movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{Sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In ''Les chataigniers a Osny'' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]], the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{Sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}

== Criticism ==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2025}}
A common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans cannot [[Self-governance|self-govern]] and so a state is necessary for human survival; this critique was supported by Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], stating that &quot;[p]eace and war, [[tariff]]s, regulations of [[Sanitation|sanitary]] conditions and the sale of noxious [[drug]]s, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.&quot;{{Sfn|Krimerman|Perry|1966|p=494}} Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of [[Isolationism|isolation]] in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism.{{Sfn|Ward|2004|p=78}}

Another criticism of anarchism is the belief that it is inherently unstable: that an anarchist society would inevitably evolve back into a state. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and other early social contract theorists argued that the state emerges in response to natural anarchy to protect the people's interests and keep order. Philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] argued that a &quot;[[night-watchman state]]&quot;, or minarchy, would emerge from anarchy through the process of an [[invisible hand]], in which people would exercise their liberty and buy protection from protection agencies, evolving into a minimal state. Anarchists reject these criticisms by arguing that humans in a [[state of nature]] would not just be in a state of war. [[Anarcho-primitivism|Anarcho-primitivists]] in particular argue that humans were better off in a state of nature in small tribes living close to the land, while anarchists in general argue that the negatives of state organization, such as hierarchies, monopolies and inequality, outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fiala |first=Andrew |title=Anarchism |date=2021 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/anarchism |access-date=2023-06-17 |edition=Winter 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy lecturer [[Andrew G. Fiala]] composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory. Anarchism also calls for collective action while endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{Sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=&quot;4. Objections and Replies&quot;}}

One of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority.{{Sfn|Ferguson|1886}}{{primary source inline|date=May 2025}} [[Joseph Raz]] states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success.{{Sfn|Gans|1992|p=37}} Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities' successful and mistaken instruction.{{Sfn|Gans|1992|p=38}} Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment.{{Sfn|Gans|1992|pp=34, 38}} Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively.{{Sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}} Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.{{Sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}}

[[Karl Marx]], considered to be one of the principal founders of [[Marxism]], criticised anarchism as the movement of the &quot;[[petty bourgeois]]&quot;, i.e. of formerly self-employed craftsmen and artisans who had been ruined by capitalistic industrialization or even war and then driven to factories; even so, they refused to subject themselves to factory discipline, party leadership, and State control, were prone to violence when frustrated, and advocated seizing factories only to break down mass production and return to craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Meltzer|first= Albert|author-link= Albert Meltzer|year= 1996|orig-year= 1981|title= Anarchism: Arguments For and Against|url= https://files.libcom.org/files/Meltzer,%20Albert%20-%20Anarchism,%20Arguments%20for%20and%20Against.PDF|edition= second revised|pages= 7–8, 55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]], who is considered Marxism's other principal founder, criticised anarchism's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian.{{Sfn|Tucker|1978}} A [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] pamphlet by  [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]], ''Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism'' argues that &quot;anarchism cannot win&quot;, believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{Sfn|Dodds|2011}} Another Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to this Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.{{Sfn|Baár|Falina|Janowski|Kopeček|2016|p=488}}

It is measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).

While directional-hemispherical [[reflectance]] factor is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henderson-Sellers |first1=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M.

This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

[[Ice–albedo feedback]] is a [[positive feedback]] climate process where a change in the area of [[ice caps]], [[glaciers]], and [[sea ice]] alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet. [[Ice]] is very reflective, therefore it reflects far more solar energy back to space than the other types of land area or open water. Ice–albedo feedback plays an important role in global [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Budyko |first=M.

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot; /&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot; /&gt;). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about {{convert|15|C|F}}. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below {{convert|−40|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot; /&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called [[ocean planet]] – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost {{convert|27|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot; /&gt;

&lt;!--===Variability and recent/spatiotemporal changes===--&gt;
In 2021, scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5% over two decades (1998–2017) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques. This may have both been co-caused by [[climate change]] as well as a substantial increase in global warming. However, the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gray |first1=Jennifer |title=The Earth isn't as bright as it once was |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/04/weather/earth-dimming-climate/index.html |access-date=19 October 2021 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goode |first1=P.

===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo===
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
* the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
* the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.
with &lt;math&gt;{1-D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (1 - D) \bar\alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{\bar\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot; /&gt;

[[Urbanization]] generally decreases albedo (commonly being 0.01–0.02 lower than adjacent [[croplands]]), which contributes to [[global warming]]. Deliberately increasing albedo in urban areas can mitigate the [[urban heat island]] effect. An estimate in 2022 found that on a global scale, &quot;an albedo increase of 0.1 in worldwide urban areas would result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing ~44 [[Gigatons|Gt]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ouyang |first1=Zutao |last2=Sciusco |first2=Pietro |last3=Jiao |first3=Tong |last4=Feron |first4=Sarah |last5=Li |first5=Cheyenne |last6=Li |first6=Fei |last7=John |first7=Ranjeet |last8=Peilei |first8=Fan |last9=Li |first9=Xia |last10=Williams |first10=Christopher A. |last11=Chen |first11=Guangzhao |last12=Wang |first12=Chenghao |last13=Chen |first13=Jiquan |date=July 2022 |title=Albedo changes caused by future urbanization contribute to global warming |journal=Nature Communications |volume=13 |issue=1 |page=3800 |bibcode=2022NatCo..13.3800O |doi=10.1038/s41467-022-31558-z |pmc=9249918 |pmid=35778380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==
[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

=== Illumination ===
Albedo is not directly dependent on the illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). However, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winston&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolation effects===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] ([[solar irradiance]]); high albedo areas in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albedo Effect |url=https://www.npolar.no/en/fact/albedo/ |website=Norsk PolarInstitutt |publisher=Norwegian Polar Institute |access-date=23 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice–albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=8 May 2017|date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
{{Further|Ice–albedo feedback}}
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass, soil, or ocean, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Dorothy K. |author-link=Dorothy Hall (scientist)|title=Remote Sensing of Ice and Snow |date=1985 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-009-4842-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]], snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (referred to as the [[Ice–albedo feedback|ice–albedo]] [[positive feedback]]).

In [[Switzerland]], the citizens have been protecting their glaciers with large white tarpaulins to slow down the ice melt. These large white sheets are helping to reject the rays from the sun and defecting the heat. Although this method is very expensive, it has been shown to work, reducing snow and ice melt by 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=swissinfo.ch/gw |date=2021-04-02 |title=Glacier tarpaulins an effective but expensive shield against heat |url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sci-&amp;-tech/glacier-tarpaulins-an-effective-but-expensive-shield-against-heat/46501004 |access-date=2024-02-20 |website=SWI swissinfo.ch |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more [[solar radiation]] than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All About Sea Ice.&quot; National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland – Melt Zone&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175416/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 |url2=https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110806084123/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 |date=3 March 2016 |date2= 6 August 2011}} page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through [[remote sensing]] techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool!

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic devices]]. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10% for vertically (90°) mounted systems, but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 |bibcode = 2013SoEn...91..233A | url = https://www.academia.edu/3081684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of [[bifacial solar cells]] where rear surface performance gains of over 20% have been observed for c-Si cells installed above healthy vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riedel-Lyngskær | first1 = Nicholas| last2 = Ribaconka | first2 = Ribaconka | last3 = Po | first3 = Mario | last4 = Thorseth | first4 = Anders | last5 = Thorsteinsson | first5 = Sune | last6 = Dam-Hansen | first6 = Carsten | last7 = Jakobsen | first7 = Michael L. | date = 2022| title = The effect of spectral albedo in bifacial photovoltaic performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 231| pages = 921–935 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2021.12.023 | bibcode = 2022SoEn..231..921R| s2cid = 245488941| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | author-link4 = J.

Forests generally have a low albedo because the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]. For this reason, the greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of [[afforestation]] (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In other words: The [[climate change mitigation]] effect of [[carbon sequestration]] by forests is partially counterbalanced in that [[reforestation]] can decrease the reflection of sunlight (albedo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Kaiguang |last2=Jackson |first2=Robert B |title=Biophysical forcings of land-use changes from potential forestry activities in North America |journal=Ecological Monographs |date=2014 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=329–353 |doi=10.1890/12-1705.1 |bibcode=2014EcoM...84..329Z |s2cid=56059160 |url=https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj20871/files/media/file/em2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover, albedo reduction may be significant enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts as strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004ClDy...22..597B | s2cid = 129640195 | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1444B  | s2cid = 45466312 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-to-high-latitude forests have a much lower albedo during snow seasons than flat ground, thus contributing to warming.

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt; Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

Research in 2023, drawing from 176 flux stations globally, revealed a climate trade-off: increased carbon uptake from [[afforestation]] results in reduced albedo. Initially, this reduction may lead to moderate global warming over a span of approximately 20 years, but it is expected to transition into significant cooling thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Graf |first1=Alexander |last2=Wohlfahrt |first2=Georg |last3=Aranda-Barranco |first3=Sergio |last4=Arriga |first4=Nicola |last5=Brümmer |first5=Christian |last6=Ceschia |first6=Eric |last7=Ciais |first7=Philippe |last8=Desai |first8=Ankur R. |last9=Di Lonardo |first9=Sara |last10=Gharun |first10=Mana |last11=Grünwald |first11=Thomas |last12=Hörtnagl |first12=Lukas |last13=Kasak |first13=Kuno |last14=Klosterhalfen |first14=Anne |last15=Knohl |first15=Alexander |date=2023-08-25 |title=Joint optimization of land carbon uptake and albedo can help achieve moderate instantaneous and long-term cooling effects |journal=Communications Earth &amp; Environment |language=en |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=298 |doi=10.1038/s43247-023-00958-4 |pmid=38665193 |pmc=11041785 |bibcode=2023ComEE...4..298G |issn=2662-4435 |hdl-access=free |hdl=10481/85323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reflectivity of smooth water at {{convert|20|C|F}} (refractive index=1.333)]]
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]].

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-01-31 |title=Arctic Reflection: Clouds Replace Snow and Ice as Solar Reflector |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/ArcticReflector/arctic_reflector4.php |access-date=2022-04-28 |website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |access-date=7 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|issue=6898|date=8 August 2002|url-status=dead|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846|last1=Travis|first1=D.

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean [[radiative forcing]] for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l.

== Astronomical albedo ==
[[File:Titan and Saturn - May 6 2012 - combined (35516187116).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is darker than [[Saturn]] even though they receive the same amount of sunlight. This is due to a difference in albedo (0.22 versus 0.499 in [[geometric albedo]]).]]In astronomy, the term '''albedo''' can be defined in several different ways, depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved.

===Optical or visual albedo===
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces. One of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the [[single-scattering albedo]]. It is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]), the size of the particle, and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

An important relationship between an object's astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is given by:&lt;ref name=&quot;bruton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;A =\left ( \frac{1329\times10^{-H/5}}{D} \right ) ^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

===Radar albedo===
In planetary [[radar astronomy]], a microwave (or radar) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target (e.g. Moon, asteroid, etc.) and the echo from the target is measured. In most instances, the transmitted pulse is [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]] and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse (SC) and the opposite sense (OC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ostro |first1=S.

P. |title=Asteroid Radar Astronomy in Asteroids III |date=2002 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=9780816522811 |pages=151–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The echo power is measured in terms of [[radar cross-section]], &lt;math&gt;{\sigma}_{OC}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\sigma}_{SC}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;{\sigma}_{T}&lt;/math&gt; (total power, SC + OC) and is equal to the cross-sectional area of a metallic sphere (perfect reflector) at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot; /&gt;

Those components of the received echo that return from first-surface reflections (as from a smooth or mirror-like surface) are dominated by the OC component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection. If the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith, there will be a significant SC component in the echo caused by multiple scattering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Asteroid_Radar&quot; /&gt;

For most objects in the solar system, the OC echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the (normalized) OC radar albedo (often shortened to radar albedo):&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot; /&gt;
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt; \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} = \frac{{\sigma}_\text{OC}}{\pi r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where the denominator is the effective cross-sectional area of the target object with mean radius, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. A smooth metallic sphere would have &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The values reported for the Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Comet P/2005 JQ5 are derived from the total (OC+SC) radar albedo reported in those references.

====Relationship to surface [[bulk density]]====
In the event that most of the echo is from first surface reflections (&lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} &lt; 0.1&lt;/math&gt; or so), the OC radar albedo is a first-order approximation of the Fresnel reflection coefficient (aka reflectivity)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Asteroid_Radar&quot; /&gt; and can be used to estimate the bulk density of a planetary surface to a depth of a meter or so (a few wavelengths of the radar wavelength which is typically at the decimeter scale) using the following empirical relationships:&lt;ref name=&quot;Shepard_M2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepard |first1=M. K. |display-authors=etal |title=A radar survey of M- and X-class asteroids II.

  (6.944 \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} + 1.083) \text{ g cm}^{-3} &amp; \text{for } \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} &gt; 0.07
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Latin letter info|a}}

'''A''', or '''a''', is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and the first [[vowel letter]] of the [[Latin alphabet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Latin-alphabet |title=Latin alphabet |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}} used in the modern [[English alphabet]], and others worldwide. Its name in English is ''[[English alphabet#Letter names|a]]'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|eɪ|audio=LL-Q1860 (eng)-Flame, not lame-A.wav}} {{respell|AY}}), plural ''aes''.{{refn|group=nb|''Aes'' is the plural of the name of the letter. The plural of the letter itself is rendered ''A''s, A's, ''a''s, or a's.}}{{sfn|Simpson|Weiner|1989|p=1}}

It is similar in shape to the [[Ancient Greek]] letter [[alpha]], from which it derives.{{sfn|McCarter|1974|p=54}} The [[uppercase]] version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version is often written in one of two forms: the double-storey {{gph|a}} and single-storey {{gph|ɑ}}. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in [[italic type]].

In English, ''[[English articles|a]]'' is the [[indefinite article]], with the
alternative form ''an''.

== Name ==
In English, the name of the letter is the ''long A'' sound, pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|eɪ}}. Its name in most other languages matches the letter's pronunciation in [[open syllable]]s.
{{wide image|Pronunciation of the name of the letter ⟨a⟩ in European languages.png|460px|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages. {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|ä}}, {{IPAblink|æ}} and {{IPAblink|ɑ}} depending on the language.}}

== History ==
The earliest known ancestor of A is ''[[aleph]]''—the first letter of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}—where it represented a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, as Phoenician only used  [[consonant]]al letters. In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]{{sfn|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}} influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

When the [[ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter representing a [[glottal stop]]—so they adapted the sign to represent the vowel {{IPAslink|a}}, calling the letter by the similar name ''[[alpha]]''. In the earliest Greek inscriptions dating to the 8th century&amp;nbsp;BC following the [[Greek Dark Ages]], the letter rests upon its side. However, in the later [[Greek alphabet]] it generally resembles the modern capital form—though many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rabinowitz |first=Harold |title=The manual of scientific style: a guide for authors, editors, and researchers |last2=Vogel |first2=Suzanne |date=2009 |publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-373980-3 |edition=1st |location=Amsterdam Burlington, MA |pages=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to the [[Italian Peninsula]], and left the form of alpha unchanged. When the Romans adopted the [[Etruscan alphabet]] to write [[Latin]], the resulting form used in the [[Latin script]] would come to be used to write many  other languages, including English.

During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter A. First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other more permanent media. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the perishable nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[majuscule]] cursive, [[minuscule]] cursive, and semi-cursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[semi-uncial]] ({{cx|3rd century}}), the uncial ({{cx|4th–8th centuries}}), and the late semi-uncial ({{cx|6th–8th centuries}}).{{sfn|Diringer|2000|p=1}}

At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century&amp;nbsp;AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semi-cursive minuscule of Italy, the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the ninth century, the [[Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.{{sfn|Diringer|2000|p=1}}

[[File:Road sign on the R639 north of Urlingford, Ireland - 20090502.jpg|thumb|right|Road sign in Ireland showing the Irish &quot;Latin alpha&quot; form of {{angbr|a}} in lower and upper case forms]]
15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form {{angbr|ɑ}}, also called ''script a'', is often used in [[handwriting]]; it consists of a circle with a vertical stroke on its right. In the hands of medieval Irish and English writers, this form gradually developed from a 5th-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] {{angbr|τ}}.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}} The Roman form {{angbr|a}} is found in most printed material, and consists of a small loop with an arc over it.{{sfn|Diringer|2000|p=1}} Both derive from the majuscule form {{angbr|A}}. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. Graphic designers refer to the ''Italic'' and ''Roman'' forms as ''single-decker a'' and ''double decker a'' respectively.

[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in Roman type. There are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' {{angbr|ɑ}}, also called ''[[Latin alpha]]'', is used in contrast with Latin {{angbr|a}}, such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds, here represented using the vowels of [[Received Pronunciation]], with [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|effects of {{angbr|r}}]] ignored and mergers in [[General American]] mentioned where relevant:
*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/æ/}} as in ''pad''
*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɑː/}} as in ''father''—merged with {{IPAslink|ɒ}} as {{IPAslink|ɑ}} in [[General American]]—which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound{{sfn|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}
*the [[open back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɒ/}} (merged with {{IPA|/ɑː/}} as {{IPAslink|ɑ}} in [[General American]]) in ''was'' and ''what''{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}
*the [[open-mid back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɔː/}} in ''water''
*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter—this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]]
*a [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}} in many unstressed syllables, as in ''about'', ''comma'', ''solar''

The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as ''Aaron'' and ''[[aardvark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.

{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}, as well as in French; it is the second most common in Spanish, and the most common in Portuguese. {{angbr|a}} represents approximately 8.2% of letters as used in English texts;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Letter frequency (English) |url=http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210304152631/http://en.algoritmy.net/article/40379/Letter-frequency-English |archive-date=2021-03-04 |access-date=2022-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the figure is around 7.6% in French&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Corpus de Thomas Tempé |url=http://gpl.insa-lyon.fr/Dvorak-Fr/CorpusDeThomasTemp%C3%A9 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930194046/http://gpl.insa-lyon.fr/Dvorak-Fr/CorpusDeThomasTemp%C3%A9 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |access-date=2007-06-15 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11.5% in Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pratt |first=Fletcher |title=Secret and Urgent: The story of codes and ciphers |publisher=Blue Ribbon |year=1942 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=254–255 |oclc=795065}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14.6% in Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Frequência da ocorrência de letras no Português |url=http://www.numaboa.com/criptografia/criptoanalise/310-Frequencia-no-Portugues |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803182254/http://www.numaboa.com/criptografia/criptoanalise/310-Frequencia-no-Portugues |archive-date=2009-08-03 |access-date=2009-06-16 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other languages ===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPAslink|a}}, {{IPAslink|ä}}, or {{IPAslink|ɑ}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}}—and the glyph {{angbr|[[Á]]}}—stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.

=== Other systems ===
* In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr IPA|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr IPA|ä}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr IPA|ɑ}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].
* In [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].

* When using [[base-16]] notation, A or a is the conventional numeral corresponding to the number 10.
* In [[algebra]], the letter ''a'' along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics.

The Latin letters {{angbr|A}} and {{angbr|a}} have [[Unicode]] [[Code|encodings]] {{unichar|0041|Latin capital letter A}} and {{unichar|0061|Latin small letter a}}. These are the same [[code point]]s as those used in [[ASCII]] and [[ISO 8859]]. There are also [[precomposed character]] encodings for {{angbr|A}} and {{angbr|a}} with diacritics, for most of those listed [[#Related characters in the Latin alphabet|above]]; the remainder are produced using [[combining diacritic]]s.

Variant forms of the letter have unique code points for specialist use: the [[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols|alphanumeric symbols set]] in mathematics and science, [[Latin alpha]] in linguistics, and [[halfwidth and fullwidth forms]] for legacy [[CJK characters|CJK]] font compatibility. The Cyrillic and Greek [[homoglyph]]s of the Latin {{angbr|A}} have separate encodings {{unichar|0410|Cyrillic capital letter A|nlink=A (Cyrillic)}} and {{unichar|0391|Greek capital letter alpha|nlink=Alpha}}.

Within Alabama, [[American football]], particularly at the [[college football|college level]], plays a major part of the state's culture.

Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Spain held Mobile as part of [[Spanish West Florida]] until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major [[Cotton production in the United States|producer of cotton]] and widely used [[African Americans|African American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slave labor]]. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the [[Confederate States of America]], with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. Following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to agriculture and a few [[cash crops]] being the main driver of the state's economy. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] from the late 19th century up until the 1960s. High-profile events such as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] made the state a major focal point of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

During and after [[World War II]], Alabama grew as the state's [[Economic diversity|economy diversified]] with new industries. In 1960, the establishment of [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in Huntsville helped boost Alabama's economic growth by developing a local [[aerospace]] industry. Alabama's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008–2018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this economic and industrial growth in recent decades, Alabama typically ranks low in terms of health outcomes, educational attainment, and median household income.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name of the [[Alabama River]] and state is derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the [[confluence]] of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is {{lang|akz|Albaamo}} (or variously {{lang|akz|Albaama}} or {{lang|akz|Albàamo}} in different dialects; the plural form is {{lang|akz|Albaamaha}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Sylestine, Cora |author2=Hardy, Heather |author3=[[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archive-date=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |title=Alabama: The State Name |access-date=August 2, 2007 |website=All About Alabama |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628215841/http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |archive-date=June 28, 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage appears in three accounts of the [[Hernando de Soto]] expedition of 1540: [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega]] used {{lang|es|Alibamo}}, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote ''Alibamu'' and ''Limamu'', respectively, in [[transliteration]]s of the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Moundville Archaeological Site Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in Hale County. It was occupied by Native Americans of the [[Mississippian culture]] from 1000 to 1450 CE.]]

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000{{spaces}}BC{{snd}}700{{spaces}}AD) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title=Alabama |date=August 11, 2006 |work=The New York Times Almanac 2004 |access-date=September 23, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016195242/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Welch |first= Paul D. |title= Moundville's Economy |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1991 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0512-3 |oclc= 21330955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Walthall |first= John A. |title= Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0552-9 |oclc= 26656858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after [[Cahokia]] in present-day [[Illinois]], which was the center of the culture.

The Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the 16th century. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through [[Mabila]] and other parts of the state in 1540.

After the French lost to the British in the [[Seven Years' War]], it became part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1783.

What are now [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and Mobile counties became part of [[Spanish West Florida]] in 1783, part of the independent [[Republic of West Florida]] in 1810, and finally part of the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the [[Yazoo lands]] beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the [[Province of Georgia]] from 1767 onwards.

Alabama was heavily [[Alabama in the American Civil War|involved in the American Civil War]].

From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: [[Jeremiah Haralson]], [[Benjamin S. Turner]], and [[James T.

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During the Reconstruction era, state legislators ratified a [[Constitution of Alabama|new state constitution]] in 1868 which created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and [[misappropriation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; Organized [[Insurgency|insurgent]], resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans.

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence.

The new 1901 constitution of Alabama included provisions for [[voter registration]] that effectively [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor European Americans, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]] and [[literacy test]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Kousser. ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were [[Literacy|literate]]. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |title=Segregation (Jim Crow) |website=Encyclopedia of Alabama |access-date=May 26, 2018 |archive-date=May 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530141129/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |access-date= September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |journal= Southern Spaces |publisher= Emory University |doi= 10.18737/M70K6P |last1= Tullos |first1= Allen |doi-access= free |archive-date= January 11, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110111023122/http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama, these schools were designed, and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS |website=National Register Information System |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/64500011_text |access-date=October 3, 2012 |archive-date=June 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220607152915/https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/64500011_text |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued racial discrimination and [[lynching]]s, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hine |first1=Darlene |last2=Hine |first2=William |last3=Harrold |first3=Stanley |title=African Americans: A Concise History |date=2012 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=9780205806270 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388 388–389] |edition=4th |url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |title=Great Migration {{!}} African-American history |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=May 26, 2018 |archive-date=May 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527024942/https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;historical populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;census data&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=Resident Population Data—2010 Census |publisher=2010.census.gov |access-date=January 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519131122/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |archive-date=May 19, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial &quot;[[gerrymandering]]&quot; violated the Constitution. In 1961,{{spaces}}... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot;&gt;James Blacksher, Edward Still, Nick Quinton, Cullen Brown and Royal Dumas.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomason2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomason |first1=Michael |title=Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city |date=2001 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa |isbn=0-8173-1065-7 |pages=213–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton and other [[cash crop]]s faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;a minority of about 25% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archive-date=October 17, 2007 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary.|access-date=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States Supreme Court cases of ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[Reynolds v.

African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public schools had to be [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]], but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor [[George Wallace]], Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5JJCAAAQBAJ&amp;q=alabama+brown+v.+board&amp;pg=PT94 |title=Brown v.

Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221054512/http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archive-date=February 21, 2007 |title=Voting Rights |access-date=September 23, 2006 |date=January 9, 2002 |website=Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', by 2017, many of Alabama's African Americans were living in Alabama's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama &quot;is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include Dallas, [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes]], [[Marengo County, Alabama|Marengo]] and [[Perry County, Alabama|Perry]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama Senate Race Between Roy Moore and Doug Jones Ends With More Controversy |first1=Jonathan |last1=Martin |first2=Alan |last2=Blinder |date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot; /&gt; Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot; /&gt;

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use [[limited voting]], as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;cum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004) |url=http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 |publisher=FairVote Archives |access-date=January 11, 2015 |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203203843/http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the state's economy shifted away from its traditional lumber, steel, and textile industries because of increased foreign competition. Steel jobs, for instance, declined from 46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridges |first1=Edwin |title=Alabama: The Making of an American State |date=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the state, particularly Huntsville, benefited from the opening of the [[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] in 1960, a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle. Technology and manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, replaced some of the state's older industries in the late twentieth century, but the state's economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area, such as Georgia and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridges |first1=Edwin |title=Alabama: The Making of an American State |date=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |pages=224–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice [[Roy Moore]] installed a statue of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the capitol in Montgomery. In 2002, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ordered the statue removed, but Moore refused to follow the court order, which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument.

{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}

The state is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |title=Encyclopedia of Alabama: Climate |date=August 17, 2007 |publisher=University of Alabama |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621180731/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |archive-date=June 21, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature is 64{{spaces}}°F (18{{spaces}}°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], while the northern parts of the state, especially in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |title=Alabama Climate |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-date=June 16, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616140321/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storms and hurricanes]]. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorm]]s. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]]; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 2004–2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010029/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf |date=April 27, 2014}}.

[[File:Phil Campbell tornado damage.jpg|thumb|Tornado damage in [[Phil Campbell, Alabama|Phil Campbell]] following the statewide [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 27, 2011, tornado outbreak]]]]
Alabama, along with [[Oklahoma]] and [[Iowa]], has the most confirmed [[Fujita scale|F5]] and [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5]] tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LIST: States with the most F5/EF5 tornadoes since 1950; Ohio high on list |work=newsnet5 |date=June 3, 2013 |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232719/http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes |archive-date=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Mike |title=April 27's record tally: 62 tornadoes in Alabama |date=August 4, 2011 |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |publisher=al.com |access-date=November 4, 2012 |archive-date=November 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109185256/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern part—along the Tennessee River Valley—is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|°F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]]. The record low of {{convert|-27|°F}} occurred on January 30, 1966, in [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |title=Record high and low temperatures for all 50 states |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=accuracyproject.org |access-date=November 3, 2012 |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many American Indian tribes such as the [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Coushatta]] inhabited present-day Alabama before European colonization.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; With Spanish, French, and British colonization of Alabama, [[White Americans|white]] and [[black Americans]] migrated to the area. From European colonization to U.S. statehood, Alabama's population grew to become increasingly [[Non-Hispanic whites|non-Hispanic white]] and African American. By the 2020 census, Alabama's total racial and ethnic population was 66.5% non-Hispanic white and 26.9% African American, with a growing [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]] population of 5.3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

Alabamians citing &quot;American&quot; ancestry are of overwhelmingly [[English Americans|English]] extraction. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census, 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total state population of 2,824,719 making them 41% of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-s1-10/tab03.pdf |title=Ancestry of the Population by State: 1980 – Table 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=February 18, 2018 |archive-date=February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224233043/http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-s1-10/tab03.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Lieberson and Lawrence Santi, 'The Use of Nativity Data to Estimate Ethnic Characteristics and Patterns', ''Social Science Research'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (1985), pp. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Lieberson and Mary C.

Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. The former constitution was particularly criticized for its complexity and length intentionally codifying segregation and racism.

[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]
Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[Legislature|legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''Reynolds v. Sims'' (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.

The [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[List of governors of Alabama|governor of Alabama]]. Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet, the [[List of lieutenant governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor of Alabama]], the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Secretary of State of Alabama|Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]].

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |title=Alabama's Legislative Process |first=McDowell |last=Lee |year=2009 |publisher=State of Alabama |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162559/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |archive-date=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[judiciary]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Constitution of Alabama]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.

=== County and local governments ===
{{See also|List of counties in Alabama}}
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;/&gt; Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''Baker v. Carr'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

&quot;The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153 |title=Home Rule |first=Albert P. |last=Brewer |publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Alabama]] |access-date=February 4, 2015 |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203220653/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (general)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud, and intimidation. After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation. Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot; /&gt; and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member district]]s that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David |date=November 2, 2010 |work=[[The Birmingham News]] |access-date=July 9, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153753/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2023|February|}}, there are a total of 3,707,233 registered voters, with 3,318,679 active, and the others inactive in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |access-date=March 2, 2023 |archive-date=December 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208174821/http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== State elections ====
With the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[Partisan primary|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the general election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-date=May 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506035723/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry Hooper Sr.|Perry O. Hooper Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=April 26, 2016|title=Chief Justice Perry Hooper remembered as GOP pioneer|url=https://www.al.com/news/2016/04/alabama_chief_justice_perry_ho.html|access-date=April 2, 2021|website=al|archive-date=June 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613164025/https://www.al.com/news/2016/04/alabama_chief_justice_perry_ho.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Courting Votes in Alabama|last=Johnson|first=Winthrop|publisher=Prescott Press, Inc.|year=1999|isbn=0-933451-41-5|location=Lafayette, Louisiana|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission, was defeated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |access-date=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archive-date=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archive-date=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |access-date=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archive-date=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are [[Steve Windom]] (1999–2003), [[Kay Ivey]] (2011–2017), and [[Will Ainsworth]] (2019–present).

==== Local elections ====
Many metropolitan and suburban counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly, most rural counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary. However, since local governments in Alabama are weaker than in other parts of the country, Republicans have the upper hand in government.

Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Republicans retain the vast majority of those posts. The current split is 18 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], and 49 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]] as of 2023. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over urban and more populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more rural counties with lower population. As of 2025, the state of Alabama has 11 African-American sheriffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sheriffs Directory – Alabama Sheriffs Association – Alabama |url=https://www.alabamasheriffs.com/sheriffs-directory |access-date=April 16, 2023 |website=www.alabamasheriffs.com |archive-date=May 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530115854/https://www.alabamasheriffs.com/sheriffs-directory |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal elections ====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Katie Britt]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]], both of whom are Republican. In the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, five of whom are Republicans ([[Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)|Mike Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Dale Strong]], [[Barry Moore (American politician)|Barry Moore]], and [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]]) and two Democrats ([[Terri Sewell]] and [[Shomari Figures]]).

=== Primary and secondary education ===
[[File:Vestavia Hills High School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vestavia Hills High School]] in the suburbs of Birmingham]]

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |title=Alabama Education Quick Facts 2012–13 |access-date=April 29, 2014 |format=PDF |archive-date=April 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429203418/http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]] and Mississippi).&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |title=Educational Attainment : 2000 : Census 2000 Brief |website=Census.gov |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-date=April 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416222303/https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513164857/http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html |date=May 13, 2008}}.

Generally prohibited in the West at large, [[school corporal punishment]] is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students [[paddle (spanking)|paddled]] at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.{{efn|This figure refers to only the number of students paddled, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be higher.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot; /&gt; The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpun.com/counuss.htm |title=Corporal punishment in US schools |publisher=[[World Corporal Punishment Research]] |last=Farrell |first=Colin |date=February 2016 |access-date=April 4, 2016 |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403071606/http://www.corpun.com/counuss.htm |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== College sports ====
College football is extremely popular in Alabama, particularly the University of Alabama [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Crimson Tide]] and Auburn University [[Auburn Tigers|Tigers]], rivals in the [[Southeastern Conference]]. Alabama averages over 100,000 fans per game and Auburn averages over 80,000—both numbers among the top twenty in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://247sports.com/LongFormArticle/College-football-Top-10-teams-by-average-home-game-attendance-during-2021-season--179922401/ |title=College football: Top 10 teams by average home game attendance during 2021 season |first=DEAN |last=STRAKA |work=[[247Sports.com]] |date=January 5, 2022 |access-date=January 19, 2022 |archive-date=January 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220109165538/https://247sports.com/LongFormArticle/College-football-Top-10-teams-by-average-home-game-attendance-during-2021-season--179922401/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant–Denny Stadium is the home of the Alabama football team, and has a [[seating capacity]] of 101,821,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bryant–Denny Stadium |url=https://rolltide.com/sports/2016/6/10/facilities-bryant-denny-html.aspx |website=RollTide.com |publisher=[[University of Alabama]] |access-date=January 19, 2022 |archive-date=January 5, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220105213939/https://rolltide.com/sports/2016/6/10/facilities-bryant-denny-html.aspx |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the fifth largest stadium in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/stadium_list/100000.shtml |title=Stadium List: 100 000+ Stadiums |publisher=World Stadiums |access-date=February 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023205044/http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/stadium_list/100000.shtml |archive-date=October 23, 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan-Hare Stadium is the home field of the Auburn football team and seats up to 87,451.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jordan-Hare Stadium |url=https://auburntigers.com/facilities/jordan-hare-stadium/11 |publisher=[[Auburn University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801135500/http://www.auburntigers.com/facilities/jordan_hare_stadium.html |archive-date=August 1, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aviation ===
{{Main|Aviation in Alabama}}

Major airports with sustained operations in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]]&lt;!--no longer Muscle Shoals Aux--&gt; (MSL) and [[Northeast Alabama Regional Airport]] (GAD).

=== Rail ===
{{Alabama rail network}}
For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at [[Anniston station|Anniston]], [[Birmingham station (Alabama)|Birmingham]], and [[Tuscaloosa station|Tuscaloosa]].

=== Roads ===
Alabama has six major interstate routes: [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59 in Alabama|I-59]] travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards [[Atlanta]]; [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|I-85]] originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. [[Interstate 22 in Alabama|I-22]] enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165 (Alabama)|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Decatur and Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685 (Alabama)|I-685]], will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]]. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, [[Interstate 222|I-222]] has been proposed, as well.

Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route 11]] (US-11), [[U.S. Route 29 in Alabama|US-29]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US-31]], [[U.S. Route 43 in Alabama|US-43]], [[U.S. Route 45 in Alabama|US-45]], [[U.S. Route 72 in Alabama|US-72]], [[U.S. Route 78 in Alabama|US-78]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|US-80]], [[U.S. Route 82 in Alabama|US-82]], [[U.S. Route 84 in Alabama|US-84]], [[U.S. Route 90 in Alabama|US-90]], [[U.S. Route 98 in Alabama|US-98]], [[U.S. Route 231 in Alabama|US-231]], [[U.S. Route 278 in Alabama|US-278]], [[U.S. Route 280 in Alabama|US-280]], [[U.S. Route 331 in Alabama|US-331]], [[U.S. Route 411 in Alabama|US-411]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]].

There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and [[Northport, Alabama|Northport]]; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]].

=== Ports ===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway]]. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonstraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 1086.

{{Greek mythology sidebar}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|iː|z|audio=LL-Q1860 (eng)-Naomi Persephone Amethyst (NaomiAmethyst)-Achilles.wav}} {{respell|ə|KIL|eez}}) or '''Achilleus''' ({{langx|grc|[[wikt:Ἀχιλλεύς|Ἀχιλλεύς]]|Achilleús}}) was a hero of the [[Trojan War]] who was known as being the greatest of all the Greek warriors. The central character in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', he was the son of the [[Nereids|Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], king of [[Phthia]] and famous [[Argonauts|Argonaut]]. Achilles was raised in Phthia along with his childhood companion [[Patroclus]] and received his education by the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]]. In the ''Iliad'', he is presented as the commander of the mythical tribe of the [[Myrmidons]].

Achilles's most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with [[Statius]]'s unfinished epic ''[[Achilleid]]'', written in the first century&amp;nbsp;CE) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel. According to that myth, when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river [[Styx]] as an infant, she held him by one of his heels, leaving it untouched by the waters and thus his only vulnerable body part.

Alluding to these legends, the term ''[[Achilles' heel]]'' has come to mean a point of weakness which can lead to downfall, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The [[Achilles tendon]] is named after him following the same legend.

Achilles's name can be analyzed as a combination of {{lang|grc|ἄχος}} (''{{transliteration|grc|áchos}}''), 'distress, pain, sorrow, grief'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3D*)axilleu%2Fs |title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1889 |via=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholia to the ''Iliad'', 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|λαός}} ({{transliteration|grc|laós}}), 'people, soldiers, nation', resulting in a proto-form ''*Akhí-lāu̯os'', 'he who has the people distressed' or 'he whose people have distress'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leonard Palmer |title=The Interpretation of Mycenaean Greek Texts |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1963 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagy&gt;{{cite web |author=Gregory Nagy |title=The best of the Achaeans |url=http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5442 |website=CHS |publisher=The Center for Hellenic Studies, Harvard University |access-date=19 March 2015 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402115312/http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5442 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|achilles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles's role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of {{lang|grc|κλέος}} {{transliteration|grc|kléos}} ('glory', usually in war). Furthermore, {{transliteration|grc|laós}} has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following [[Leonard Palmer]], to mean 'a corps of soldiers', a [[muster (military)|muster]].&lt;ref name=Nagy /&gt; With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

Some researchers deem the name a [[loan word]], possibly from a [[Pre-Greek]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot; /&gt; Achilles's descent from the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and a similarity of his name with those of [[River gods (Greek mythology)|river deities]] such as [[Acheron]] and [[Achelous]] have led to speculations about his being an old [[Greek sea gods|water divinity]] {{see below|{{section link||Worship and heroic cult}}, below}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the supportive position of {{cite journal |author=Hildebrecht Hommel |title=Der Gott Achilleus |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften |issue=1 |year=1980 |pages=38–44}}&amp;nbsp;– A critical point of view is taken by {{cite journal |author=J.

Pearse):

&quot;It is said ... that he [Akhilleus (Achilles)] was called Podarkes (Podarces, Swift-Footed) by the Poet [i.e. Homer], because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arke (Arce) and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arke. And Arke was the daughter of Thaumas and her sister was Iris; both had wings, but, during the struggle of the gods against the Titanes (Titans), Arke flew out of the camp of the gods and joined the Titanes. After the victory Zeus removed her wings before throwing her into Tartaros and, when he came to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, he brought these wings as a gift for Thetis.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth and early years ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 181.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Thetis Dipping the Infant Achilles into the River Styx'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] ({{circa|1625|lk=no}}; [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], Rotterdam)]]

Achilles was the son of [[Thetis]]—a [[Nereid]] and daughter of the [[Old Man of the Sea]]—and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for Thetis's hand in marriage until [[Prometheus]], the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by [[Themis]], goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755–768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34–37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26–47; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the ''[[Argonautica]]'' (4.760) Zeus's sister and wife [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god [[Nereus]], was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Education of Achilles 1862 Delacroix.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'', by [[Eugène Delacroix]], pastel on paper, {{circa|1862|lk=no}} ([[Getty Center]], Los Angeles)]]

According to the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the first century&amp;nbsp;CE, and to [[Lost literary work|non-surviving previous sources]], when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Achilleid'' 1.269; Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jonathan S.

It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier.

She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' ({{circa|1772|lk=no}}), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] ([[Yale Center for British Art]])]]

None of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'', Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaios]], son of [[Pelagon]], challenged Achilles by the river [[Scamander]]. He was ambidextrous, and cast a spear from each hand; one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Homer (Robert Fagles translation) |title=The Iliad |page=525 |quote=But the other (spear) grazed Achilles's strong right arm and dark blood gushed as the spear shot past his back}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the few fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] which describe the hero's death (i.e. the ''[[Cypria]]'', the ''[[Little Iliad]]'' by [[Lesches]] of Pyrrha, the ''[[Aethiopis]]'' and ''[[Iliupersis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]]), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel. In the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]], who lived on [[Mount Pelion]] and was known as the most righteous of the [[Centaur]]s, to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87–89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830–832.&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts, Achilles's original name was &quot;Ligyron&quot; and he was later named ''Achilles'' by his tutor Chiron.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, Library, Book III [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.13&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 3.13.6]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Homer, Achilles grew up in [[Phthia]] with his childhood companion [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot; /&gt; Homer further writes that Achilles taught Patroclus what he himself had been taught by Chiron, including the medical arts.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'' [[wikisource:The Iliad (Murray)/Book XI|Book XI 822-836]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.410ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Achilleus Lyra.jpg|thumb|[[Chiron]] teaching Achilles how to play the [[lyre]], Roman [[fresco]] from [[Herculaneum]], first century&amp;nbsp;CE]]

According to [[Photius]], the sixth book of the ''New History'' by [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus. When she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron. Later Chiron exhumed the body of the [[Damysus (Giant)|Damysus]], who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles' burnt foot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_copyright/photius_05bibliotheca.htm Photius, ''Bibliotheca'', cod. 190]: &quot;Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; six were born; when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed and tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to Chiron. The latter exhumed the body of the giant Damysos who was buried at Pallene—Damysos was the fastest of all the giants—removed the 'astragale' and incorporated it into Achilles' foot using 'ingredients'. This 'astragale' fell when Achilles was pursued by Apollo and it was thus that Achilles, fallen, was killed. It is said, on the other hand, that he was called Podarkes by the Poet, because, it is said, Thetis gave the newborn child the wings of Arce and Podarkes means that his feet had the wings of Arce.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical description ===
In Homer's ''Iliad'', Achilles is portrayed as tall and striking, with strength and looks that were unmatched among the Greek warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Strauss |first=Barry |url= |title=The Trojan War: A New History |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7432-6442-6 |pages=87 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer describes him as having long hair or a mane ({{lang|grc|χαίτη}}).&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+23.141&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0133 23.141] (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|xai/th|χαίτη|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with some other characters, his hair is described with the word ''xanthḗ'' ({{lang|grc|ξανθή}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Myres&quot;&gt;Myres, John Linton (1967).

Some post-Homeric sources&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Skyrioi'', surviving only in fragmentary form; [[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], ''Imagines'' i; Scholiast on Homer's ''Iliad'', 9.326; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 13.162–180; Ovid, ''[[Tristia]]'' 2.409–412 (mentioning a Roman tragedy on this subject); Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3.13.8; [[Statius]], ''[[Achilleid]]'' 1.689–880, 2.167ff.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of [[Lycomedes of Scyros|Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].

There, Achilles, properly disguised, lived among Lycomedes's daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;[[Pyrrha (mythology)|Pyrrha]]&quot; (the red-haired girl), Cercysera or Aissa (&quot;swift&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Graves |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Graves |title=The Greek Myths – The Complete and Definitive Edition |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |year=2017 |isbn=978-0-241-98338-6 |pages=Index s.v.

According to this story, Odysseus learned from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus went to Skyros in the guise of a pedlar selling women's clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly took up the spear, Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes's women. While the women fled in panic, Achilles prepared to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

== In the Trojan War ==
[[File:Achilles by Lycomedes Louvre Ma2120.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A marble representation of Achilles at the court of King [[Lycomedes]], {{circa|240 CE|lk=no}}]]

According to the ''Iliad'', Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[Myrmidons]]. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, [[Eudoros|Eudorus]], Peisander, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and Alcimedon.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 16.168–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telephus ===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]], where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pseudo-Apollodorus |title=Bibliotheca, Epitome 3.20 |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#69 |website=theoi.com |ref=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other reports in [[Euripides]]'s lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epitome 3.20&quot; /&gt;

=== Troilus ===
[[File:Achilles slaying Troilus.PNG|thumb|left|Achilles slaying Troilus, red-figure kylix signed by [[Euphronios]]]]

According to the ''[[Cypria]]'' (the part of the [[Epic Cycle]] that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles's wrath), when the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of [[Aeneas]], sacked neighbouring cities (such as [[Pedasus]] and [[Lyrnessus]], where the Greeks capture the queen [[Briseis]]) and killed [[Tenes]], a son of [[Apollo]], as well as Priam's son [[Troilus]] in the sanctuary of Apollo [[Thymbra]]ios; however, the romance between Troilus and [[Chryseis]] described in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' and in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' is a medieval invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |access-date=9 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009120320/http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |archive-date=9 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New Pauly&quot; /&gt;

Cf. [[Vergil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.474–478.&lt;/ref&gt; Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister [[Polyxena]], and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth—who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo [[Thymbra]]ios.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca Epitome'' 3.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia to [[Lycophron]] 307; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], Scholia to the ''Aeneid'' 1.474.&lt;/ref&gt; In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html &quot;Zeus Be Nice Now&quot;] in ''London Review of Books'', 19 July 2007. Retrieved 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents.

=== In the ''Iliad'' ===
[[File:Achilles Agamemnon Pompei mosaic NAMNaples 10006.jpg|thumb|Achilles and [[Agamemnon]], from a mosaic from [[Pompeii]], first century&amp;nbsp;CE]]

Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath ({{lang|grc|μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως}}, {{tlit|grc|mênis Achilléōs}}) is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος&lt;br /&gt;
οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκε, [...]
|Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,&lt;br /&gt;
the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the Achaeans, [...]
|}

[[File:Wall painting - Briseis taken away from Achilles - Pompeii (VI 8 5) - Napoli MAN 9105 - 01.jpg|thumb|Achilles cedes [[Briseis]] to [[Agamemnon]], from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], fresco, first century&amp;nbsp;CE ([[Naples National Archaeological Museum]])]]

The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles's death. It begins with Achilles's withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' slave [[Briseis]], the daughter of [[Briseus]], be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis),&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334–343.&lt;/ref&gt; with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles [[Homeric prayer|prays]] to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]]. They promise that, if Achilles returns to battle, Agamemnon will return the captive Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he is planning to do.

[[File:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|left|''The Rage of Achilles'', fresco by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1757, Villa Valmarana ai Nani, Vicenza)]]

The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, wearing Achilles's armour, although Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]], who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles's rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey.

[[File:The Triumph of Achilles by Franz von Matsch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|''The Triumph of Achilles'', fresco by [[Franz von Matsch]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], Greece]]

Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favourite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that, &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991: 22.346.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of [[funeral games]] in honour of his companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lattimore |first1=Richmond |title=The Illiad of Homer |date=2011 |publisher=The University of Chicago |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-46937-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/iliad00home_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion's dog ([[Sirius]]); a sign of evil. During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to [[Hesperus]], the evening/western star ([[Venus]]), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]], the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]] (Argeiphontes), Hector's father [[Priam]] goes to Achilles's tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of [[Niobe]]'s offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

=== Penthesilea and Memnon ===
[[File:Akhilleus Memnon Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1410.jpg|thumb|Achilles and Memnon fighting, between Thetis and Eos, Attic black-figure amphora, {{circa|510&amp;nbsp;BCE|lk=no}}, from Vulci]]

Later works, including the ''[[Aethiopis]]'' (seventh century&amp;nbsp;BCE) and a work named ''[[Posthomerica]]'', composed by [[Quintus of Smyrna]] in the fourth century&amp;nbsp;CE, relate further events from the [[Trojan War]]. When [[Penthesilea]], queen of the [[Amazons]] and daughter of [[Ares]], arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]], 3.11.15; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially taken aback, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.

Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son [[Antilochus]] becomes Achilles' closest companion. Achilles already loved Antilochus, so Menelaus thought Antilochus would be the best person to inform Achilles of Patroclus' death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'', [https://topostext.org/work/225#2.7.1 2.7.1] ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0601%3Abook%3Dpos%3D2%3Achapter%3D7 Original Greek text])&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], son of the Dawn Goddess [[Eos]] and king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]], slays Antilochus as he sacrifices himself to save his father. According to [[Philostratus of Lemnos|Philostratus]]' ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'', Achilles laments his death on the battlefield, promising Antilochus a glorious funeral and vengeance. Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'', [https://topostext.org/work/225#2.7.2 2.7.2] ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0601%3Abook%3Dpos%3D2%3Achapter%3D7 Original Greek text])&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad''{{'}}s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the seventh century&amp;nbsp;BCE. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

=== Achilles and Patroclus ===
{{Main|Achilles and Patroclus}}

The exact nature of Achilles's relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus had sexual relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tribal Imagination: Civilization and the Savage Mind |author=Robin Fox |year=2011 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-06094-4 |quote=There is certainly no evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers. |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YCxy_4Bt1F0C&amp;pg=PA223 223]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life |last=Martin |first=Thomas R |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-14844-3 |quote=The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers. Achilles and his equally close friend Patroclus provided the legendary model for this friendship, but Homer in the ''Iliad'' never suggested that they had sex with each other. (That came from later authors.). |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the ''Iliad'' that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In fifth-century&amp;nbsp;BCE Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'']], which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one, usually a teenager. In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673–674.&lt;/ref&gt; In Xenophon's ''Symposium'', Socrates says that Achilles and Patroclus were not lovers but had a platonic relationship. [[Kenneth Dover]] argues that ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.{{citation needed|date=January 2025}}

=== Death ===
[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|left|''Dying Achilles'' (Achilleas thniskon) in the gardens of the Achilleion]]

The death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions.&lt;ref&gt;Abrantes 2016: c. 4.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the oldest account in book 22 of the ''Iliad'', [[Hector]] predicts with his last dying breath that [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and Apollo will slay him at the Scaean Gates leading to Troy (with an arrow to the heel according to Statius). In book 23, the sad spirit of dead Patroclus visits Achilles just as he drifts off into slumber, requesting that his bones be placed with those of Achilles in his golden vase, a gift of his mother.

[[File:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|right|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles, [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure [[lekythos]] from Sicily, {{Circa|510 BCE}} ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich).]]

In book 11 of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and Odysseus tells him of Neoptolemus' actions.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 11.467–564.&lt;/ref&gt;

Book 24 of ''Odyssey'' gives dead King Agamemnon's ghostly account of Achilles' death: the bleached bones from Achilles's funeral [[pyre]] had been mixed with those of [[Patroclus]] and put into his mother's golden vase. Also, the bones of [[Antilochus of Pylos|Antilochus]], who had become closer to Achilles than any other following Patroclus's death, were separately enclosed. The customary funeral games of a hero were performed, and a massive tomb or [[mound]] was built on the [[Hellespont]] for approaching seagoers to celebrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Odyssey of Homer |author=Richmond Lattimore |publisher=Harper Perennial |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-06-124418-6 |location=New York |page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achilles was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]]. Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him. According to [[Bibliotheca (Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], after his death he married [[Medea]] in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;Dräger, paras. 1, 4; [[Bibliotheca (Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg002.perseus-eng1:e.5.5 E.5.5].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fate of Achilles' armour ===
[[File:Odysseus Ajax Louvre F340.jpg|thumb|left|Oinochoe, {{circa|520 BCE|lk=no}}, Ajax and Odysseus fighting over the armour of Achilles]]

Achilles's armour was the object of a feud between Odysseus and [[Ajax the Great]]. They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who, after considering the presentations of both men, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena, who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles. When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades (''Odyssey'' 11.543–566), Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus.

The armour they fought for was made by [[Hephaestus]] and thus much stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft. Thetis had the gear made for Achilles because his first set was worn by [[Patroclus]] when he went to battle and taken by Hector when he killed Patroclus. The [[Shield of Achilles]] was also made by the fire god. His legendary spear was given to him by his mentor [[Chiron]] before he participated in the [[Trojan War]]. It was called the Pelian Spear, which allegedly no other man could wield.

A relic claimed to be Achilles's bronze-headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333&amp;nbsp;BCE by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear; however, it was shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the second century&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'', 1973, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': ''Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing'' (1980:65–85, especially 81).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achilles, Ajax and a game of ''petteia'' ===
Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and Ajax were playing a board game (''petteia'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html &quot;Petteia&quot;.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209122834/http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html |date=9 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html &quot;Greek Board Games&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408090534/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html |date=8 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html &quot;Latrunculi&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915044905/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioannis Kakridis]] (1988).

The tomb of Achilles,&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

The spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greeks]] that had [[Second Greek colonisation|settled]] on the northern coast of the [[Pontus Euxinus]], today's [[Black Sea]], appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the [[Miletus|Milesian]] colony of [[Olbia (Pontic)|Olbia]] as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] ({{langx|uk|Зміїний}}, {{tlit|uk|Zmiinyi}}, near [[Kiliia]], Ukraine). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the [[Greek colonies]] on the Black Sea ([[graffiti]] and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being [[votive offering]]s, from Olbia, the area of [[Berezan Island]] and the [[Tauric Chersonese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hildebrecht Hommel |title=Der Gott Achilleus |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften |issue=1 |year=1980 |pages=38–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;) attest the existence of a [[heroic cult]] of Achilles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. T. |last=Hooker |title=The cults of Achilleus |journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie |volume=131 |issue=3 |date=1988 |pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the sixth century&amp;nbsp;BCE onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century&amp;nbsp;CE, when dedicatory [[stelae]] from Olbia refer to an ''Achilles Pontárchēs'' (Ποντάρχης, roughly 'lord of the sea', or 'lord of the [[Pontus Euxinus]]'), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with [[Olympian gods]] such as the local [[Apollo]] Prostates, [[Hermes]] Agoraeus,&lt;ref name=Hedreen /&gt; or [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Smyrnaeus, 3.770–779.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 CE) in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' mentions a &quot;port of the Achæi&quot; and an &quot;island of Achilles&quot;, famous for the tomb of that &quot;man&quot; ({{lang|la|portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara}}), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]]; furthermore, at 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s from this island, he places a peninsula &quot;which stretches forth in the shape of a sword&quot; obliquely, called ''Dromos Achilleos'' (Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος, ''Achilléōs drómos'', '[[Racecourse of Achilles|the Race-course of Achilles]]')&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.12.83 ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D26#note-link10 chapter 4.26]).&lt;/ref&gt; and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him.&lt;ref name=Hedreen /&gt; This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic [[Spit (landform)|spit]], called today ''Tendra'' (or ''Kosa Tendra'' and ''Kosa Djarilgatch''), situated between the mouth of the [[Dnieper]] and [[Karkinit Bay]], but which is hardly 125&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s (around 185&amp;nbsp;km) away from the [[Dnieper-Bug estuary]], as Pliny states (to the &quot;Race-course&quot; he gives a length of {{cvt|80|miles}}, whereas the spit measures around {{cvt|70|km}} today).

In the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as ''Achillea'' and introduces two further names for it: ''Leuce'' or ''Macaron'' (from Greek {{lang|grc|[νῆσος] μακαρῶν}}, 'island of the blest'). The &quot;present day&quot; measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of ''Achillea'' or ''Leuce'' with today's [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.13.93 ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D27 chapter 4.27]): &quot;Researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120 from [[Tyras]], and of fifty from the island of [[Peuce Island|Peuce]]. It is about ten miles in circumference.&quot; Although afterwards he speaks again of &quot;the remaining islands in the Gulf of [[Kerkinitis|Carcinites]]&quot; which are &quot;Cephalonesos, Rhosphodusa [or Spodusa], and Macra&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's contemporary [[Pomponius Mela]] ({{circa|43&amp;nbsp;CE|lk=no}}) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named ''Achillea'', situated between the [[Borysthenes]] and the [[Danube|Ister]], adding to the geographical confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Pomponius Mela, ''De situ orbis'' 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain {{ill|Nikolay Kritsky|ru|Критский, Николай Дмитриевич}} in 1823 on [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]]. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth-century&amp;nbsp;BCE [[Black-glazed Ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: &quot;Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke.&quot; In another inscription from the fifth or fourth centuries&amp;nbsp;BCE, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.&lt;ref name=Hedreen /&gt;

The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on ''Leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''[[Aethiopis]]'' according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical {{lang|el|Λεύκη Νῆσος}} ({{tlit|el|Leúkē Nêsos}}, 'White Island').&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''Chrestomathia'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the fifth century&amp;nbsp;BCE, [[Pindar]] had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a &quot;bright island&quot; ({{lang|grc|φαεννά νᾶσος}}, {{tlit|grc|phaenná nâsos}}) of the Black Sea,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.49ff.; Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[Island of the Blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[Peleus]] and [[Cadmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Olympia'' 2.78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Well known is the connection of these mythological [[Fortunate Isles]] (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, ''makárôn nêsoi'') or the Homeric [[Elysium]] with the stream [[Oceanus]] which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it.&lt;ref name=Hedreen /&gt; Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], speaking of &quot;Achilles lord of Scythia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D. Page, ''Lyrica Graeca Selecta'', Oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles' fight against the [[Aethiopia]]n prince [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[Eos]] after his death.

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' ({{circa|130 CE|lk=no}}) gives the following details:

{{blockquote|It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus' honour, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honour Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles' temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles' honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles' oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn't run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Densuşianu&quot; /&gt;}}

The Greek geographer [[Dionysius Periegetes]], who probably lived during the first century&amp;nbsp;CE, wrote that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Periegetes, ''Orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.&lt;ref name=Hedreen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21; Scholion to Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the [[Delphi]]c [[Pythia]] sent a lord of [[Crotone|Croton]] to be cured of a chest wound.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabo]] mentioned that the cape of the Racecourse of Achilles was sacred to Achilles and although it was treeless, was called Alsos (ἄλσος).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:7.3.19 Strabo, Geography, 7.3.19]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alsos'' in Greek means '[[Grove (nature)|grove]]'.

A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Strabo]] reported on the existence of a town {{tlit|grc|Achílleion}} ({{lang|grc|Ἀχίλλειον}}), built by settlers from [[Mytilene]] in the sixth century&amp;nbsp;BCE, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the [[Troad]].&lt;ref name=Troad /&gt; Later attestations point to an ''Achílleion'' in [[Messenia]] (according to [[Stephanus Byzantinus]]) and an ''Achílleios'' (Ἀχίλλειος) in [[Laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.25.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of [[Aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called [[Chilia Veche|Chilia]] (presumably from an older ''Achileii''), although his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Densuşianu&quot;&gt;Nicolae Densuşianu: ''Dacia preistorică''. Bucharest: Carol Göbl, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 216, the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception during antiquity ==

=== In Greek tragedy ===
{{Main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}
The Greek tragedian [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'', a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radt. ''Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149–157a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the fifth century&amp;nbsp;BCE, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; [[Euripides]] refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot;&gt;Latacz 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary tragedians, such as [[Astydamas]], wrote works on Achilles that are completely lost today.

=== In Greek philosophy ===

==== Zeno ====
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centred one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;[[Epithets in Homer#Individuals|swift-footed]]&quot; [[Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

==== Plato ====
In ''[[Hippias Minor]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]] attributed to [[Plato]], an arrogant man named Hippias argues with [[Socrates]]. The two get into a discussion about lying. They decide that a person who is intentionally false must be &quot;better&quot; than a person who is unintentionally false, on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying.&lt;ref name=&quot;hm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jowett |first1=Benjamin |author2=Plato |title=Lesser Hippias |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1673/1673-h/1673-h.htm |publisher=Project Gutenberg |date=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates uses various analogies, discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point. The two also reference Homer extensively. Socrates and Hippias agree that [[Odysseus]], who concocted a number of lies throughout the ''Odyssey'' and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle, was false intentionally. Achilles, like Odysseus, told numerous falsehoods. Hippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man, while Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit. The two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident. Socrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point: someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally.

=== In Roman and medieval literature ===
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latacz 2010&quot; /&gt; [[Virgil]] refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.28, 1.30, 3.87.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Horace]] portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 4.6.17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, such as [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]] and in [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]'s {{lang|fr|[[Roman de Troie]]}} and [[Guido delle Colonne]]'s ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the [[Matter of Troy]] until the seventeenth&amp;nbsp;century.

Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler [[Leo the Deacon]], not as [[Hellenes|Hellene]], but as [[Scythians|Scythian]], while according to the Byzantine author [[John Malalas]], his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekonomou |first1=Andrew |title=Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes |date=2007 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=UK |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zomZk6DbFTIC&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&amp;pg=PA123 |access-date=14 September 2015 |isbn=978-0-7391-1977-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeffreys |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Croke |first2=Brian |title=Studies in John Malalas |publisher=Australian Association for Byzantine Studies, Department of Modern Greek, University of Sydney |location=Sydney |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p55mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles |access-date=14 September 2015 |isbn=978-0-9593626-5-7 |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Namesakes ==
* The name of Achilles has been used for at least nine [[Royal Navy]] warships since 1744—both as {{HMS|Achilles}} and with the French spelling {{HMS|Achille}}. A 60-gun ship of that name served at the Battle of Belleisle in 1761 while a 74-gun ship served at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Other battle honours include Walcheren 1809. An armored cruiser of that name served in the Royal Navy during the First World War.
* {{HMNZS|Achilles|70|6}} was a {{sclass|Leander|cruiser|1||1931}} which served with the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] in World War II. It became famous for its part in the [[Battle of the River Plate]], alongside {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}} and {{HMS|Exeter|68|6}}. In addition to earning the battle honour 'River Plate', HMNZS ''Achilles'' also served at Guadalcanal 1942–1943 and Okinawa in 1945. After returning to the Royal Navy, the ship was sold to the [[Indian Navy]] in 1948, but when she was scrapped parts of the ship were saved and preserved in New Zealand.

'''Abraham Lincoln'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ən|audio=LL-Q1860 (eng)-Naomi Persephone Amethyst (NaomiAmethyst)-Lincoln.wav}} {{Respell|LINK|ən}}}} (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th [[president of the United States]], serving from 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] in 1865. He led the United States through the [[American Civil War]], defeating the [[Confederate States of America]] and playing a major role in the [[End of slavery in the United States|abolition of slavery]].

Lincoln was born into [[poverty]] in [[Kentucky]] and raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and [[U.S. representative]]. Angered by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854, which opened the territories to slavery, he became a leader of the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 Senate campaign debates]] against [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. Lincoln won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], prompting the slave states to begin to [[Secession in the United States|secede]] and form the Confederate States of America. A month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attacked Fort Sumter]], starting the Civil War.

Lincoln, a [[Moderate Republicans (Reconstruction era)|moderate Republican]], had to navigate a contentious array of factions in managing conflicting political opinions during the war effort. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Southern ports. He suspended the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in April 1861, an action that Chief Justice [[Roger Taney]] found unconstitutional in ''[[Ex parte Merryman]]'', and he averted war with Britain by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. On January 1, 1863, he issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which declared the slaves in the states &quot;in rebellion&quot; to be free. On November 19, 1863, he delivered the [[Gettysburg Address]], which became one of the most famous speeches in American history. He promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which, in 1865, abolished [[chattel slavery]]. [[1864 United States presidential election|Re-elected in 1864]], he sought to heal the war-torn nation through [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]].

On April 14, 1865, five days after the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Confederate surrender at Appomattox]], Lincoln was attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln is remembered as a [[martyr]] and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery.

==Family and childhood==
===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born into hardship on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin on [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=20–22}}&lt;ref name=anb/&gt; The second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], he was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from England to [[Massachusetts]] in 1638,{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 1&amp;ndash;4}} and of the [[Harrison family of Virginia]].{{efn|Lincoln's grandmother, though uncertain, is believed to have been Bathsheba Herring, the daughter of Alexander and Abigail Herring ({{née}} Harrison).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40189910|last=Coleman|first=Charles|title=Lincoln's Lincoln grandmother|journal=Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society|date=1959 |volume=52|issue=1|pages=59&amp;ndash;90}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} His paternal grandfather and namesake, [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Captain Abraham Lincoln]], moved the family from [[Virginia]] to [[Kentucky]]. The captain was killed in a [[Northwest Indian War|Native American raid]] in 1786.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 1&amp;ndash;4}} The family settled in [[Hardin County, Kentucky]], in the early 1800s.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=21&amp;ndash;22}} Lincoln's mother Nancy is widely assumed to have been the daughter of Lucy Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=79}} Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 4}} They had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas; Thomas died as an infant.{{sfn|White|2009|p=18}}

Lincoln's father bought multiple farms in Kentucky but could not get clear [[Recording (real estate)|property titles]] to any, losing hundreds of acres in legal disputes.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=22–24|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 6&amp;ndash;8}} In 1816, the family moved to [[Indiana]], where land titles were more reliable.{{sfn|Winkle|2011|pp=6&amp;ndash;7}} They settled on a forested plot in [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]], Indiana.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 22&amp;ndash;23}} In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=34, 156}} At various times he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of a [[Separate Baptists|Separate Baptist Church]], a pious evangelical group whose members largely opposed slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=24}} Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas obtained [[clear title]] to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} in Indiana's Little Pigeon Creek Community in 1827.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=24, 104}}

On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died from [[milk sickness]], leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of the household, which included her father, 9-year-old Abraham, and Nancy's 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=22–23, 77}} Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died in childbirth, devastating Lincoln.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=34, 116}} On December 2, 1819, Thomas married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]], a widow with three children of her own.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt; Abraham became close to his stepmother and called her &quot;Mama&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=27–28}}

===Education and move to Illinois===
Lincoln was largely self-educated.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=10, 33}} His formal schooling was from [[itinerant teacher]]s. It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read, but probably not to write. After moving to Indiana at age seven, he attended school only sporadically, for a total of less than 12 months by age 15.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp= 23, 29}} Nonetheless, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.{{sfn|Madison|2014|p=110}}

When Lincoln was a teenager his father relied heavily on him for farmwork and for supplementary income, hiring the boy out to area farmers and pocketing the money, as was the custom at the time.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 30, 41}} Lincoln and some friends took goods by [[flatboat]] to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, where the [[slave market]]s, according to the historian [[Michael Burlingame]], &quot;would leave an indelible impression on him.... It was the first time, but not the last, that he would be repelled while observing slavery firsthand.&quot;{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 43&amp;ndash;44}}

In March 1830, fearing another milk-sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Abraham, moved west to Illinois and settled in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=36}} Abraham became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part due to his father's lack of interest in education;{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=71}} he would later refuse to attend his father's deathbed or funeral in 1851.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt;

===Marriage and children===

Some historians, such as Michael Burlingame, identify Lincoln's first romantic interest as [[Ann Rutledge]], a young woman also from Kentucky whom he met when he moved to [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]].{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 98}} [[Lewis Gannett]], however, disputes that the evidence supports a romantic relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Gannett | first=Lewis | date=Winter 2005 | title='Overwhelming evidence' of a Lincoln&amp;ndash;Ann Rutledge romance?: reexamining Rutledge family reminiscences | url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext | journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association| pages=28–41 | volume=26|issue=1| doi=10.5406/19457987.26.1.04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Herbert Donald]] states that &quot;How that friendship [between Lincoln and Rutledge] developed into a romance cannot be reconstructed from the record&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=56–57}} Rutledge died on August 25, 1835, of [[typhoid fever]]. Lincoln took her death very hard, sinking into a serious depression and contemplating suicide.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=55–58|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 p. 100}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanticoct2005&quot; /&gt;

In the early 1830s, he met [[Mary Owens (Abraham Lincoln fiancée)|Mary Owens]] from Kentucky.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=56–57, 69–70}} Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived that November and he courted her, but they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she declined to marry him.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=67&amp;ndash;69}} In 1839, Lincoln met [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]], and the following year they became engaged.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=80–86|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 174&amp;ndash;176}} She was the daughter of [[Robert Smith Todd]], a wealthy lawyer and businessman in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Lamb|Swain|2008|p=3}} Lincoln initially broke off the engagement in early 1841, but the two were reconciled and married on November 4, 1842.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 182, 194–195}} In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near his law office.{{sfn|Baker|1989|p=142}}

The marriage was turbulent; Mary was verbally abusive and at times physically violent towards her husband.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 202}} They had four sons. The eldest, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], was born in 1843, and was the only child to live to maturity. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie), born in 1846, died February 1, 1850, probably of [[tuberculosis]]. Lincoln's third son, [[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]], was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever at the [[White House]] on February 20, 1862. The youngest, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and died of edema at age 18 on July 16, 1871.{{sfnm|White|2009|1pp=179–181, 476|Manning|2016|2pp=24, 34, 58, 73, 75, 139, 181}} Lincoln loved children,{{sfn|White|2009|p=126}} and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own.{{sfnm|Baker|1989|1p=120|Manning|2016|2pp=39, 42}} The deaths of Eddie and Willie had profound effects on both parents. Lincoln suffered from &quot;[[history of depression|melancholy]]&quot;, a condition now thought to be [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanticoct2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression |title=Lincoln's great depression |first=Joshua Wolf |last=Shenk |date=October 2005 |work=The Atlantic |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044732/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincoln-apos-s-great-depression/4247/ |archivedate=October 9, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early vocations and militia service ===
{{Further|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}
In 1831, Lincoln's father moved the family to [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|a new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], after which Abraham struck out on his own.{{sfn|Manning|2016|p=12}} He made his home in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]], for six years.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=23–53}} During 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in New Salem.{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=86–95}} He gained a reputation for strength and courage after winning a [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling]] match with the leader of a group of ruffians known as the Clary's Grove boys.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=40&amp;ndash;41}} In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], though he interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the [[Illinois Militia]] during the [[Black Hawk War]].{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=86–95}} He was elected the captain of his militia company but did not see combat.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 67}} In his political campaigning, Lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the [[Sangamon River]].{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 72}} He drew crowds as a [[raconteur]], but he lacked name recognition, powerful friends, and money, and he lost the election.{{sfnm|Winkle|2001|1pp=114–116|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 71–75}}

When Lincoln returned home from the war, he planned to become a [[blacksmith]] but instead purchased a New Salem general store in partnership with William Berry. Because a license was required to sell customers alcoholic beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the [[Lincoln-Berry General Store|Lincoln&amp;ndash;Berry General Store]] became a [[tavern]] as well.{{sfn|Meacham|2022|p=38}} But according to Burlingame, Berry was &quot;an undisciplined, hard-drinking fellow&quot;, and Lincoln &quot;was too soft-hearted to deny anyone credit&quot;;{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 76}} although the economy was booming, the business struggled and went into debt, prompting Lincoln to sell his share.{{sfn|Meacham|2022|p=38}}

Lincoln served as New Salem's [[postmaster]] and later as [[county surveyor]], but he continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 77–81, 87}} Rather than studying in the office of an established attorney, as was customary, Lincoln [[reading law|read law]] on his own, borrowing legal texts, including [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Commentaries]]'' and [[Joseph Chitty|Chitty]]'s ''Pleadings'', from attorney [[John Todd Stuart]].{{sfn|Kent|2022|pp=121&amp;ndash;122}} He later said of his legal education that he &quot;studied with nobody.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=55}}

In Lincoln's second state house campaign in 1834, as a supporter of [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader [[Henry Clay]], he finished second among thirteen candidates running for four places.{{sfn|White|2009|p=59}} Lincoln echoed Clay's support for the [[American Colonization Society]], which advocated abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in [[Liberia]].{{sfn|Foner|2010|pp=17–19, 67}} The Whigs also favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] such as railroads, and urbanization.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=137–153}}

On January 27, 1838, Lincoln delivered [[Abraham Lincoln's Lyceum address|an address at the Lyceum]] in Springfield, after the murder of the anti-slavery newspaper editor [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]]. In this ostensibly non-partisan speech, Lincoln indirectly attacked [[Stephen Douglas]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], who the Whigs argued were supporting &quot;mobocracy&quot;; he also attacked anti-abolitionism and racial bigotry.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 140–142}} He was criticized in the press for a planned duel with [[James Shields (politician, born 1806)|James Shields]], whom he had ridiculed in letters published under the name &quot;Aunt Rebecca&quot;; though the duel ultimately did not take place, Burlingame noted that &quot;the affair embarrassed Lincoln terribly&quot;.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 190–194}}

===U.S. House of Representatives (1847–1849)===

In 1843, Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|Illinois's 7th district seat]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]; [[John J.

Lincoln spoke against the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846&amp;ndash;1848), for which he said President [[James K.

Lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=124}} Realizing Henry Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=126&amp;ndash;127}} Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed commissioner of the [[United States General Land Office]].{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=138&amp;ndash;140|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 296&amp;ndash;303}} The administration offered to appoint him secretary of the [[Oregon Territory]] instead.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 305&amp;ndash;307}} This would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=55–57}}

===Prairie lawyer===
{{See also|List of cases involving Abraham Lincoln}}
In his Springfield practice, according to Donald, Lincoln handled &quot;virtually every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=96}} He dealt with many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the new railroad bridges. In 1849 he received [[Abraham Lincoln's patent|a patent for a flotation device]] for the movement of [[riverboat]]s in shallow water{{sfn|Emerson|2009|pp=27&amp;ndash;28}} and Lincoln initially favored riverboat legal interests, but he represented whoever hired him.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=156–157|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 p. 253}} He represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in ''[[Hurd v.

Lincoln represented William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong in his 1858 trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}} The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After a witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the Moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|pp=150–151|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 345&amp;ndash;346}} In an 1859 murder case, he defended &quot;Peachy&quot; Quinn Harrison, the grandson of [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright]], Lincoln's political opponent.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 560}} Harrison was charged with the murder of Greek Crafton who, according to Cartwright, said as he lay dying that he had &quot;brought it upon myself&quot; and that he forgave Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Mitgang |first1=Herbert |date=February 10, 1989 |title=The law; Lincoln as lawyer: transcript tells murder story |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/10/nyregion/the-law-lincoln-as-lawyer-transcript-tells-murder-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln angrily protested the judge's initial decision to exclude Cartwright's claim as [[hearsay]]. Lincoln argued that the testimony involved a [[dying declaration]] and so was not subject to the hearsay rule.

The [[Compromise of 1850]] failed to alleviate tensions over slavery between the slave-holding South and the free North.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=175–176}} As the slavery debate in the [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] and [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery, but Douglas's [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=188–190}} Lincoln's [[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]] of October 1854, in which he declared his opposition to slavery,{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=148–152}} was one of an estimated 175 speeches he delivered in the next six years on the topic of excluding slavery from the territories.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt; Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–205}}

Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other ineffective efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, &quot;I think I am a whig; but others say there are no whigs, and that I am an abolitionist.... I now do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|p=215}} The new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was formed as a northern party dedicated to anti-slavery, drawing from the anti-slavery wing of the Whig Party and combining [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and anti-slavery Democratic Party members,{{sfn|McGovern|2009|pp=38–39}} Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–204}} Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[Know Nothing]] movement.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=191–194}} In 1854, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature, but before the term began he declined to take his seat so that he would be eligible to run in the upcoming U.S. Senate election.{{sfnm|White|2009|1pp=203–205|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 390, 392}} At that time, senators were elected by state legislatures. After leading in the first six rounds of voting, Lincoln was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]], an anti-slavery Democrat who had received few votes in the earlier ballots. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's anti-slavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=205–208}}

==== 1856 campaign ====
[[Bleeding Kansas|Violent political confrontations in Kansas]] continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the [[1856 United States elections|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the [[Bloomington Convention]], where the [[Illinois Republican Party]] was established. The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention, calling for the preservation of the Union.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=216–221}} At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], Lincoln received support to run as vice president, but ultimately the party put forward a ticket of [[John C. Frémont]] and [[William Dayton]], which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated [[James Buchanan]] and the Know Nothings nominated [[Millard Fillmore]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=224–228}} Buchanan prevailed, while Republican [[William Henry Bissell]] won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=229–230}}{{efn|[[Eric Foner]] contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt [[White people]] and blocked progress.

==== ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' ====
{{Main|Dred Scott v. Sandford}}
[[Dred Scott]] was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the [[Missouri Compromise]].

Taney]] wrote in his opinion that Black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners' property rights. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=236–238}} Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].{{sfn|Zarefsky|1993|pp=69–110}} He argued that the decision was at variance with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which stated that &quot;all men are created equal ... with certain unalienable rights&quot;, among them &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;.{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|pp=299–300}}

{{Further|Lincoln–Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}

In 1858, Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–248}} For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–250}} Lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. After his nomination he delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand.&quot; I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half ''slave'' and half ''free''. I do not expect the Union to be ''dissolved''—I do not expect the house to ''fall''—but I ''do'' expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.{{sfn|White|2009|p=251}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion.{{sfn|Harris|2007|p=98}} When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, &quot;[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&amp;nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.&quot;{{sfn|White|2009|p=258}}

The Senate campaign featured [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|seven debates]] between Lincoln and Douglas; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew thousands.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=214–218|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 487&amp;ndash;488}} Lincoln warned that the Slave Power was threatening the values of republicanism, and he accused Douglas of distorting Jefferson's premise that [[all men are created equal]]. In his [[Freeport Doctrine]], Douglas argued that, despite the ''Dred Scott'' decision, which he claimed to support, local settlers, under [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], should be free to choose whether to allow slavery in their territory. He accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|pp=201&amp;ndash;203, 212–224|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 501&amp;ndash;504, 527&amp;ndash;531}}

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. However, Lincoln's articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=89–90}} In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate. While Lincoln was popular in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=291–293}} In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and, in the following months, [[William O. Stoddard]]'s ''Central Illinois Gazette'', the ''Chicago Press &amp; Tribune'', and other local papers endorsed his candidacy.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=307–308}}

On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at the Cooper Union]]. In this address Lincoln argued that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery; he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|p=473}} Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly.{{sfn|Holzer|2004|pp=108–111}} But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership, which brought him into contention for the presidency. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience&quot;.{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=97|Holzer|2004|2p=157}} Historian David Herbert Donald described the speech as &quot;a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=240}} In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=241}}

On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=244}} Exploiting his embellished frontier legend of clearing land and splitting fence rails, Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of &quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=244&amp;ndash;245}} On May 18 at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt; A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for vice president to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]].{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 625}}

Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=10, 13, 18}} When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from the Southern slave states elected incumbent Vice President [[John C.

Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–248}} A nationwide militaristic Republican youth organization, the [[Wide Awakes]], &quot;turned it into one of the most excited elections in American history&quot; and &quot;triggered massive popular enthusiasm&quot;, according to the political historian Jon Grinspan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Young men for war': the Wide Awakes and Lincoln's 1860 presidential campaign|last=Grinspan|first=Jon|journal=Journal of American History|volume=96|issue=2|page=377|jstor=25622297}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for him.{{sfn|Murrin|2006|p=464}}

As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. Republican speakers emphasized Lincoln's childhood poverty to demonstrate the power of &quot;free labor&quot;, which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=254–256}} Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit and write to Lincoln. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the [[Old State Capitol State Historic Site|Illinois state capitol]] to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired [[John George Nicolay]] as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=251–252|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 1 pp. 650&amp;ndash;652}}

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the first Republican president. His victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states.{{sfnm|Mansch|2005|1p=61|Donald|1996|2p=256}} Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8 percent of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon, and winning the electoral vote decisively.{{sfn|White|2009|p=350}}

Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]] as contrary to the party's platform of free-soil in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=360–361}} Lincoln said, &quot;I will suffer death before I consent&amp;nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=268}} Lincoln supported the [[Corwin Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which would have protected slavery in states where it already existed.

Due to secessionist plots, Lincoln and his train received careful attention to security. The president-elect evaded suspected [[Baltimore Plot|assassins in Baltimore]]. He traveled in disguise, wearing a soft felt hat instead of his customary [[stovepipe hat]] and draping an overcoat over his shoulders while hunching to conceal his height. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in Washington, D.C., which was placed under military guard. Many in the opposition press criticized his secretive journey; opposition newspapers mocked Lincoln with caricatures showing him sneaking into the capital.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=273–279|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 2 pp. 32&amp;ndash;39}} Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states:

{{Blockquote|Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that &quot;I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.&quot;|[[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|First inaugural address]], 4 March 1861{{sfnm|Sandburg|2002|1p=212|Lincoln|1953|2p=333}}|source=}} The president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: &quot;We are not enemies, but friends....

In selecting his cabinet, Lincoln chose the men he found the most competent, even when they had been his opponents for the presidency. Lincoln commented on his thought process, &quot;We need the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.&quot;{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|p=319}} Goodwin described the group in her biography of Lincoln as a &quot;[[Team of Rivals|team of rivals]]&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005}} Lincoln named his main political opponent, [[William H. Seward]], as Secretary of State.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 722}}

Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]], a prominent corporate lawyer from Ohio, replaced [[John McLean]] after the latter's death in April 1861. Like McLean, Swayne opposed slavery.{{sfn|Silver|1998|p=59}} [[Samuel Freeman Miller]], who replaced [[Peter V.

====Commander-in-Chief====
{{Main|American Civil War|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln - NARA - 528325.jpg|thumb|alt=President Abraham Lincoln in 1862|Portrait of Lincoln {{circa}} 1862]]

In early April 1861, [[Robert Anderson (Union officer)|Major Robert Anderson]], commander of [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston, South Carolina, advised that he was nearly out of food. After considerable debate, Lincoln decided to send provisions; according to Michael Burlingame, he &quot;could not be sure that his decision would precipitate a war, though he had good reason to believe that it might&quot;.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 100&amp;ndash;124}} On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces [[Battle of Fort Sumter|fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter]].{{sfn|McClintock|2008|pp=246&amp;ndash;250}} Donald concludes: &lt;blockquote&gt;His repeated efforts to avoid collision ... showed that he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he had also vowed not to surrender the forts.... The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the Confederates to fire the first shot.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=293}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The April 12 and 13 attack on Fort Sumter rallied the Northern public to see military action against the South as necessary to defend the nation.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 134&amp;ndash;138, 154&amp;ndash;155}} On April 15, [[Proclamation 80|Lincoln called for 75,000 militiamen]] to recapture forts, protect Washington, and preserve the Union. This call forced states to choose whether to secede or to support the Union. North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas seceded. As the Northern states sent regiments south, on April 19 Baltimore mobs in control of the rail links [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains. Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|arresting local Maryland officials]]. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]'', allowing arrests without formal charges.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1a3=Coles|1y=2002|1p=174|2a1=Burlingame|2y=2008|2loc=vol. 2 pp. 141, 146&amp;ndash;151}}

[[John Merryman]], a Maryland officer arrested for hindering U.S. troop movements, successfully petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Taney to issue [[Habeas corpus in the United States|a writ of ''habeas corpus'']]. In an opinion titled ''[[Ex parte Merryman]]'', Taney, not ruling on behalf of the Supreme Court, wrote that the Constitution authorized only Congress and not the president to suspend habeas corpus. But Lincoln engaged in [[nonacquiescence]] and persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas.{{sfnm|Harris|2011|1pp=59–71|White|2011 |2pp=38–39}} Under various suspensions, 15,000 civilians were detained without trial; several, including the anti-war Democrat [[Clement L. Vallandigham]], were tried in military courts for &quot;treasonable&quot; actions, which was condemned as an attack on free speech.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt;{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=442&amp;ndash;443}}

====Early Union military strategy====
{{Main|Eastern theater of the American Civil War|Western theater of the American Civil War}}
{{Further|Trans-Mississippi theater of the American Civil War|Lower seaboard theater of the American Civil War}}
Lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military strategy. He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as [[commander-in-chief]] by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions. Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=302–304|Carwardine|2003|2pp=163–164}} 

It was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions in both political parties. Copperheads (anti-war Democrats) criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery; the [[Radical Republicans]] (who demanded harsh treatment against secession) criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=315–339, 417}} On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|Confiscation Act]], which authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. The law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=314|Carwardine|2003|2p=178}}

Seward|William Seward]], and [[Gideon Welles]].]]

Lincoln's war strategy had two priorities: ensuring that Washington was well defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory.{{efn|Major Northern newspapers predicted victory within 90 days.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=295–296}}}} Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet. Occasionally, Lincoln's wife, Mary, prevailed on him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=391–392}} Early in the war, Lincoln selected civilian generals from varied political and ethnic backgrounds &quot;to secure their and their constituents' support for the war effort and ensure that the war became a national struggle&quot;.{{sfn|Work|2024|p=2}} In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron as [[United States Secretary of War|war secretary]] with [[Edwin Stanton]].{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 240&amp;ndash;244}} Stanton worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than did any other senior official. According to Stanton's biographers Benjamin Thomas and Harold Hyman, &quot;Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together&quot;.{{sfn|Thomas|Hyman|1962|pp= 71, 87, 229–230, 385}}

Lincoln saw the importance of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] for control of the [[Mississippi River]] valley and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than merely capturing territory.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=432–436}} In directing the Union's war strategy, Lincoln valued the advice of [[Winfield Scott]], even after his retirement as [[Commanding General of the United States Army]]. In 1861 Scott proposed the [[Anaconda Plan]], which relied on port blockades and advancing down the Mississippi to subdue the South. In June 1862, Lincoln made an unannounced visit to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], where he spent five hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the war.{{sfnm|Burlingame|2008|1loc=vol. 2 pp. 180, 320|Marvel|2008|2p=68}}

Internationally, Lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the Confederacy.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=213–214}} He relied on his combative Secretary of State William Seward while working closely with [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] chairman [[Charles Sumner]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=321&amp;ndash;322}} In 1861 the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the ''[[RMS Trent]]'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys. Although the North celebrated the seizure, Britain protested vehemently, and the [[Trent Affair]] threatened war between the Americans and the British. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 222&amp;ndash;227}}

{{main|George B. McClellan}}

After the Union rout at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]] and Winfield Scott's retirement, Lincoln appointed [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=318–319}} Early in the war, McClellan created defenses for Washington that were almost impregnable: 48 forts and [[artillery battery|batteries]], with 480 guns manned by 7,200 artillerists.{{sfn|Sears|1999|p=116}} He spent months planning his Virginia [[Peninsula Campaign]]. McClellan's slow progress and excessive precautions frustrated Lincoln. McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's cautiousness in having reserved troops for the capital.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=349–352}} In 1862, Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief; he elevated Henry Halleck to the post and appointed [[John Pope (general)|John Pope]] as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]].{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 303, 320, 368}} In the summer of 1862 Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], forcing him to retreat to Washington. Soon after, the Army of Virginia was disbanded.{{sfn|Work|2024|p=71}}

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington, which included both the [[Army of the Potomac]] and the remains of the Army of Virginia.{{sfnm|Goodwin|2005|1pp=478–479|Work|2024|2p=71}} Two days later, [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|pp=478–480}} This battle, a Union victory, was among the bloodiest in American history.{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|p=481}} A crisis of command occurred for Lincoln when McClellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's withdrawing army, while [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]] and McClellan with [[Ambrose Burnside]]; according to Donald, this was a &quot;shrewd&quot; political move as they were non-partisan&amp;mdash;unlike McClellan, a Democrat.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=390}} Against presidential advice, Burnside launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was [[Battle of Fredericksburg|defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg]] in December.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 445&amp;ndash;446}} Facing low morale and discontent among the troops, Lincoln replaced Burnside with [[Joseph Hooker]].{{sfnm|Burlingame|2008|1loc=vol. 2 pp. 484&amp;ndash;486|Donald|1996|2pp=411–412}} Hooker endured heavy casualties at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May, then resigned in June and was replaced by [[George Meade]].{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 498, 503, 510&amp;ndash;511}} Meade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and defeated him in the [[Gettysburg campaign]] but then failed to effectively block Lee's orderly retreat to Virginia, despite Lincoln's demands. At the same time, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=444–447}}
In May 1863, Lincoln issued the [[Lieber Code]], which governed wartime conduct of the Union Army, defining command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://opil.ouplaw.com/display/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e2126|last=Labuda|first=Patryk|title=Lieber Code|encyclopedia=Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Union generals had issued emancipation orders in 1861 and 1862, but Lincoln overrode both: he found that the decision to emancipate was not within the generals' power, and that it might induce loyal border states to secede.{{sfn|Guelzo|1999|pp=290–291}} However, in June 1862, Congress passed an act banning slavery in all federal territories, which Lincoln signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/this-abominable-slavery/page/7_1_ab|title=The United States Congress outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude in all U.S. territories, June 20, 1862|accessdate=April 28, 2025|work=This Abominable Slavery|publisher=University of Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was enacted,{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 p. 357}} allowing the targeted seizure of slaves for those disloyal to the United States. On July 22, 1862, Lincoln reviewed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=364–365}} Senator [[Willard Saulsbury Sr.]] criticized the proclamation, stating that it &quot;would light their author to dishonor through all future generations&quot;.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=416}} By contrast, [[Horace Greeley]], editor of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', in his public letter, &quot;The Prayer of Twenty Millions&quot;, implored Lincoln to embrace emancipation.{{sfnm|McPherson|1992|1p=124|Lundberg|2019|2p=116}} In a public letter of August 22, 1862, Lincoln replied to Greeley that while he personally wished all men could be free, his first obligation as president was to preserve the Union:{{sfn|Guelzo|2004|pp=147–153}}

{{Blockquote|My paramount object in this struggle ''is'' to save the Union, and is ''not'' either to save or to destroy slavery.

Buttressed by news of the recent Union victory at Antietam, on September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. On January 1, 1863, he issued the final version,{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 468&amp;ndash;469}} freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/emancipation-proclamation|title=Emancipation Proclamation (1863)|date=August 16, 2021 |publisher=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; exempting areas under such control.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=379}} Lincoln commented on signing the Proclamation: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=407}} On New Year's Eve in 1862, Black people – enslaved and free – gathered across the United States to hold Watch Night ceremonies for &quot;Freedom's Eve&quot;, looking toward the promised fulfillment of the Proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=June 19, 2019 |title=The historical legacy of Juneteenth |url=https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/historical-legacy-juneteenth |publisher=National Museum of African American History and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective, Union armies advancing south enabled thousands to escape bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McPherson |first1=James M. |title=Who freed the slaves? |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |date=March 1995 |volume=139 |issue=1 |page=9|jstor=986716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln gave the dedication for the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Gettysburg battlefield cemetery]] on November 19, 1863.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=453–460}} He asserted that the nation was &quot;conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;, and that the deaths of the &quot;brave men ... who struggled here&quot; would not be in vain, but that the nation &quot;shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=460–466|Wills|2012|2pp=20, 27, 105, 146}} The address became the most quoted speech in American history.{{sfn|Bulla|Borchard|2010|p=222}}

Following Admiral [[David Farragut]]'s [[capture of New Orleans]] in 1862, and after victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, Lincoln proclaimed a national [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]], to be celebrated on the final Thursday of November 1863.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=471}}

====Promoting Grant====

{{main|Ulysses S. Grant}}

Grant's victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|p=315}} Following Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and after Grant's success at [[Chattanooga campaign|Chattanooga]] Lincoln promoted Grant to commander of all Union armies.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt; 

Lincoln reacted to Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=422–424}} Union forces targeted infrastructure—plantations, railroads, and bridges—to weaken the South's morale and fighting ability.{{sfn|Witt|2013|pp=276&amp;ndash;277}} While Lincoln sanctioned this approach, he emphasized the defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction for its own sake.&lt;ref name=neely&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neely|first=Mark E. Jr.|author-link=Mark E. Neely Jr.|year=2004|title=Was the Civil War a total war?|journal=Civil War History|volume=50 |issue=4|pages=438–448|doi=10.1353/cwh.2004.0073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant's bloody [[Overland Campaign]]{{sfn|McPherson|2009|p=113}} turned into a strategic success for the Union despite a number of setbacks. But the campaign was the bloodiest in American history: approximately 55,000 casualties on the Union side (including 7,600 deaths), compared to about 33,000 on the Confederate (including 4,200 deaths). Lee's losses, although lower in absolute numbers, were proportionately higher (over 50%) than Grant's (about 45%).{{sfnm|Young|2013|1pp=242–243|Tucker|2014|2p=159}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Rhea|first=Gordon|date=Spring 2014|title=The Overland Campaign of 1864|magazine=Hallowed Ground|url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/overland-campaign-1864}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early April, the Confederate government evacuated Richmond and Lincoln visited the conquered capital.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=589}}

Amid the turmoil of military actions, on June 30, 1864, Lincoln signed into law the [[Yosemite Grant]], which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as [[Yosemite National Park]].{{sfn|Schaffer|1999|p=48}} According to Rolf Diamant and Ethan Carr, &quot;the Yosemite Grant was a direct consequence of the war ... an embodiment of the ongoing process of remaking government ... an intentional assertion of a steadfast belief in the eventual Union victory.&quot;{{sfn|Diamant|Carr|2022|pp=54&amp;ndash;55}}

====Fiscal and monetary policy====
{{Main|Economic history of the United States Civil War}}

[[File:US-$1-LT-1862-Fr-16c.jpg|thumb|alt=Both sides of a one-dollar bill|One-dollar &quot;greenback&quot;]]
Lincoln and Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase faced a challenge in funding a wartime economy. Congress quickly approved Lincoln's request to assemble an army, even increasing his proposed 400,000 soldiers to 500,000, but both Congress and Chase initially resisted raising taxes.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|pp=27–28}} After the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, which collapsed the bond market, Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]]. This act imposed the first [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. federal income tax]], creating a flat tax of three percent on annual incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollars). The preference for taxation based on income rather than property reflected the increasing amount of wealth held in stocks and bonds; for example, Representative [[Schuyler Colfax]] declared during the debate, &quot;I cannot go home and tell my constituents that I voted for a bill that would allow a man, a millionaire, who has put his entire property into stock, to be exempt from taxation, while a farmer who lives by his side must pay a tax&quot;.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|pp=30–35, 85}} As the average urban worker made approximately $600 per year, many were not required to pay income taxes.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|pp=111–112}}{{efn|In 1866, when income tax applied to those with incomes above $600, only an estimated 1.3% of the national population were required to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollack|first=Sheldon|title=The first national income tax, 1861–1872|journal=The Tax Lawyer|volume=67|issue= 2|year= 2014|pages= 311–330|jstor=24247751}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lincoln also signed increases to the [[Morrill Tariff]], which had become law in the final months of Buchanan's tenure. These tariffs raised import duties considerably and were designed both to increase revenue and to help manufacturers offset the burden of new taxes.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|pp=113–114}} Throughout the war, Congress debated whether to raise additional revenue primarily by increasing tariff rates, which most strongly affected rural areas, or by increasing [[income tax]]es, which most affected wealthier individuals; the latter view proved more popular.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|p=85}} 

The revenue measures of 1861 proved inadequate for funding the war, forcing Congress to take further action.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|pp=37–38}} In February 1862, Congress passed the [[Legal Tender Act]], which authorized the minting of $150 million in &quot;[[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]]&quot;—the first [[banknote]]s issued by the U.S. government since the end of the [[American Revolution]]. Greenbacks were not backed by [[gold]] or [[silver]], but rather by the government's promise to honor their value. By the end of the war, $450 million worth of greenbacks were in circulation.{{sfnm|Paludan|1994|1pp=109–110|Weisman|2002|2p=37}}{{efn|Government borrowing amounted to $2.8 billion by 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weisman|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Congress also passed the Revenue Act of 1862, which established an [[excise tax]] affecting nearly every commodity, as well as the first national [[Estate tax in the United States|inheritance tax]].{{sfnm|Paludan|1994|1p=111|Weisman|2002|2pp=41&amp;ndash;42}}&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack1&quot;/&gt; It also added a [[progressive tax]] structure to the federal income tax.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|pp=40–42}} To collect these taxes, Congress created the Office of the [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollack|first1=Sheldon D.|title=The first national income tax, 1861–1872|journal=Tax Lawyer|date=2014|volume=67|issue=2|url=https://udel.edu/~pollack/Downloaded%20SDP%20articles,%20etc/academic%20articles/The%20First%20National%20Income%20Tax%2012-18-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the new revenue measures, funding the war remained challenging.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|pp=81–82}} The government continued to issue greenbacks and borrow large amounts of money, and the U.S. national debt grew from $65 million in 1860 to over $2 billion in 1866.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|pp=109–110}} The [[Revenue Act of 1864]] represented a compromise between those who favored a more progressive tax structure and those who favored a flat tax.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|pp=84–88}}&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack1&quot; /&gt; It established a five-percent tax on incomes above $600 and a ten-percent tax on incomes above $10,000, and it raised taxes on businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack1&quot; /&gt; In early 1865, Congress reduced the threshold for ten-percent taxation to incomes above $5000.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|pp=90–91}} By the end of the war, the income tax constituted about one-fifth of the federal government's revenue,&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack1&quot; /&gt; though it was intended as a [[State of emergency|temporary wartime measure]].{{sfn|Brownlee|2004|pp=34&amp;ndash;37}}&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack1&quot; /&gt;

Lincoln also took action against wartime fraud, signing into law the [[False Claims Act of 1863]]. This statute imposed penalties for false claims and made it possible for private citizens to file false-claim (''[[qui tam]]'') lawsuits on behalf of the U.S. government and share in the recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamer|first= Sean|year=1996|title=Lincoln's law: constitutional and policy issues posed by the ''qui tam'' provisions of the false claims act|journal=Kansas Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|issue=2|pages= 89&amp;ndash;106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The False Claims Act: a primer |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/civil/legacy/2011/04/22/C-FRAUDS_FCA_Primer.pdf |accessdate=March 13, 2025 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to stabilize the currency, Lincoln convinced Congress to pass the [[National Banking Act]] in 1863, established the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] to oversee &quot;national banks,&quot; which were subject to federal, rather than state, regulation. In return for investing a third of their capital in federal bonds, national banks were authorized to issue federal banknotes.{{sfn|Weisman|2002|p=82}} After Congress imposed a tax on private banknotes in March 1865, federal banknotes became the dominant form of paper currency.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|p=112}} Other economic policies passed under Lincoln included the [[1862 Homestead Act]], which made millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at low cost. The 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] provided government grants for [[List of agricultural universities and colleges|agricultural colleges]] in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[first transcontinental railroad]], which was completed in 1869.{{sfnm|Paludan|1994|1pp=114&amp;ndash;116|Reynolds|2020|2p=663}}

====Foreign policy====
{{Further|Diplomacy of the American Civil War|History of U.S. foreign policy, 1861–1897}}
At the start of the war, Russia was the lone [[great power]] to support the Union, while the other European powers had varying degrees of sympathy for the Confederacy.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=226–230}} According to the historian Dean Mahin, Lincoln had &quot;limited familiarity with diplomatic practices&quot; but had a &quot;substantial influence on U.S. diplomacy&quot; as the Union attempted to avoid war with Britain and France.{{sfn|Mahin|1999|pp=2&amp;ndash;3}} Lincoln appointed diplomats to try to persuade European nations not to recognize the Confederacy.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 p. 93}} Lincoln's policy succeeded: all foreign nations were officially neutral throughout the Civil War, with none recognizing the Confederacy.{{sfnm|Herring|2008|1pp=226–230|Mahin|1999|2p=22}} Some European leaders looked for ways to exploit the inability of the U.S. to enforce the [[Monroe Doctrine]] opposing European colonial intervention in the Americas: Spain invaded the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1861, while France established [[second Mexican Empire|a puppet regime]] in [[Mexico]].{{sfnm|Herring|2008|1pp=224–229|Doyle|2015|2p=8}} However, many in Europe also hoped for a quick end to the war, both for humanitarian reasons and because of the economic disruption it caused.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=230, 240–241}}

The European aristocracy was &quot;absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed&quot;, according to [[Don H. Doyle]]. Union diplomats initially had to explain that the United States was not committed to ending slavery, and instead they argued that secession was unconstitutional. Confederate spokesmen, on the other hand, were more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for independence, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy.{{sfnm|Doyle|2015|1pp=5–8, 55, 69–70|Mahin|1999|2pp=19&amp;ndash;21}} However, the Confederacy's hope that cotton exports would compel European interference did not come to fruition, as Britain found alternative sources and maintained economic ties with the Union.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=235–236}} Though the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 did not immediately end the possibility of European intervention, it rallied European public opinion to the Union by adding abolition as a Union war goal. Any chance of a European intervention in the war ended with the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, as European leaders came to believe that the Confederate cause was doomed.{{sfnm|Herring|2008|1pp=242–246|Mahin|1999|2pp=22, 209}}

====Native Americans====
Lincoln appointed [[William P. Dole]] as commissioner of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and made &quot;extensive use of Indian Service positions to reward political supporters&quot;, according to the author Thomas Britten.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 p. 85}}&lt;ref name=native&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1gq5s34k|title=Abraham Lincoln as Great Father: a look at federal Indian policy, 1861&amp;ndash;1865|last=Britten|first=Thomas|journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|year=2016|volume=40|issue=3|pages=103–122 |doi=10.17953/aicrj.40.3.britten}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's policies largely focused on assimilation of Native Americans and diminishing tribal landholdings, consistent with those of his predecessors, but his direct involvement in Native American affairs was unclear.&lt;ref name=native/&gt; His administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraph lines from Native American attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nichols|first=David Allen|year=1974|title=The other civil war: Lincoln and the Indians|journal=Minnesota History|url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/44/v44i01p002-015.pdf|archiveurl=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/44/v44i01p002-015.pdf|archivedate=October 9, 2022|url-status=live|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tensions arose with the [[Dakota people]] due to American treaty violations, unfair trading, and government practices that led to starvation.&lt;ref name=chomsky/&gt; In August 1862, the [[Dakota War of 1862|Dakota War]] broke out in Minnesota. Hundreds of settlers were killed and 30,000 were displaced from their homes.{{sfn|Clodfelter|1998|pp=40&amp;ndash;41, 61}} Some feared incorrectly that it might represent a Confederate conspiracy to start a war on the Northwestern frontier.{{sfn|Finkelman|2018|p=127}} Lincoln ordered thousands of paroled prisoners of war be sent to put down the uprising.

Lincoln responded, &quot;I could not afford to hang men for votes.&quot;{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 p. 483}} Lincoln called for reform of federal Indian policy but prioritized the war and Reconstruction. Changes were made in response to the [[Sand Creek Massacre]] of November 1864, prioritizing peaceful administration of Native affairs and condemning those encroaching on Native territory, but not until after Lincoln's death.{{sfn|Green|2021|pp=38–39, 95&amp;ndash;99}}

===Second term===

====Re-election====
{{Main|1864 United States presidential election}}

Lincoln ran for re-election in 1864; the Republican Party selected Andrew Johnson, a [[War Democrat]], as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]].{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=494–507|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 2 p. 642}} Grant's bloody stalemates and Confederate victories such as the [[Battle of the Crater]] damaged Lincoln's re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt;{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 pp. 658, 667}} Lincoln prepared a confidential memorandum pledging that, if he should lose the election, he would &quot;co-operate with the President-elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards&quot;.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt;{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=529}}

Victories at [[Atlanta campaign|Atlanta]] in September and in the [[Valley campaigns of 1864#Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign (August–October 1864)|Shenandoah Valley]] in October turned public opinion, and Lincoln was re-elected.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt; As Grant continued to weaken Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. At one point, [[Alexander H. Stephens]], the Confederate vice president, led a meeting with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal, and the only agreement formed at the meeting concerned the exchange of prisoners.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=565|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 2 p. 758}} 

On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[second inaugural address]]. Historian [[Mark Noll]] places the speech &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world;&quot; it is inscribed in the [[Lincoln Memorial]].{{sfn|Noll|2002|p=426}} Lincoln closed his speech with these words:
{{Blockquote|With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/linc/learn/historyculture/lincoln-second-inaugural.htm|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|title=Lincoln's second inaugural address|accessdate=April 27, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A month later, on April 9, Lee [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|surrendered to Grant at Appomattox]], signaling the end of the war.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=583–589}} It triggered a series of subsequent surrenders across the South&amp;mdash;in [[North Carolina]], [[Alabama]], and the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|trans-Mississippi Theater]]&amp;mdash;and finally at sea with the surrender of the [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']] in November 1865.{{sfn|Winik|2006|p=191}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2015/spring/cw-surrenders.html|title=Ending the bloodshed: the last surrenders of the Civil War|last=Plante|first=Trevor|magazine=Prologue|date=Spring 2015|volume=47|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reconstruction====
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}
Reconstruction preceded the war's end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy&quot;;{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=509–512}} he focused not on blame for the war but on rebuilding.{{sfn|Koehn|2017|p=191}} Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they signed an oath of allegiance. Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Charles Sumner and [[Benjamin Wade]], who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=471–472}}

As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were being restored. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln appointed Johnson and [[Frederick Steele]], respectively, as military governors.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=484}} In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed, but only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the plan to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan, the 1864 [[Wade–Davis Bill]], but Lincoln [[pocket veto|pocket-vetoed]] it. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1pp=509&amp;ndash;511|Burlingame|2008|2loc=vol. 2 pp. 594&amp;ndash;600, 659&amp;ndash;664}}

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|upright=1.4|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|An 1865 political cartoon, ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union'', depicting Vice President [[Andrew Johnson]], a former tailor, and Lincoln.]]
After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery nationwide with a constitutional amendment. By December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=554}} The Senate passed it on April 8, 1864, but the first vote in the House of Representatives fell short of the required two-thirds majority. Passage became part of Lincoln's re-election platform, and after his re-election, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31, 1865.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=562–563}} After ratification by three-fourths of the states in December 1865, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], abolishing &quot;slavery [and] involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime&quot;.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 p. 751}}

Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military administration, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists. He also signed Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability for the freedmen to purchase title. In signing it, according to the historian [[Richard Carwardine]], Lincoln &quot;acknowledged that the government had at least some responsibility for the material needs of millions of ex-slaves&quot;,{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=238–243}} although it fell short of the &quot;[[forty acres and a mule]]&quot; that many slaves understood they would receive from confiscated property.{{sfn|Schwartz|2000|p=86}} [[Eric Foner]] argues that &quot;Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land.&quot;{{sfn|Foner|2010|p=335}} However, the Lincoln scholar [[Phillip S. Paludan]] suggests that at the end of his life Lincoln was moving towards a more radical position, particularly with regards to freedmen's rights.{{sfn|Paludan|1994|pp=308&amp;ndash;309}} Foner adds that, had Lincoln lived into the [[Reconstruction era]], &quot;It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.&quot;{{sfn|Foner|2010|p=335}}

====Assassination====
{{Main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|}}
[[File:Lincoln assassination slide c1900 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of Lincoln being shot by Booth while sitting in a theater booth.|An illustration of [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's assassination]] on April 14, 1865, in the presidential booth at [[Ford's Theatre]], featuring (left to right): assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]], Abraham Lincoln, [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[Clara Harris]], and [[Henry Rathbone]]]]

[[John Wilkes Booth]] was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts within the Confederate secret service.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=586–587}} After attending Lincoln's last public address, on April 11, 1865, in which Lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some Black men, specifically &quot;on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-last-public-address|title=The President's last public address|website=The American Presidency Project|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara|accessdate=May 3, 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booth plotted to assassinate the President.{{sfn|Harrison|2010|pp=3–4}} When Booth learned of the Lincolns' intent to attend a play with Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at [[Ford's Theatre]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2005|pp=734&amp;ndash;735}} Lincoln and his wife attended the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on the evening of April 14.

==Philosophy and views==
[[File:George P.A. Healy - Abraham Lincoln - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=Lincoln sitting with his hand on his chin and his elbow on his leg.|''[[Abraham Lincoln (Healy)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' (1869)]]
Lincoln redefined the political philosophy of [[republicanism in the United States]]. Because the Declaration of Independence says that all men have an unalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, he called it the &quot;[[sheet anchor]]&quot; of republicanism, at a time when the Constitution was the focus of most political discourse.{{sfnm|1a1=Jaffa|1y=2000|1p=399|2a1=Jividen|2y=2011|2pp=12&amp;ndash;15}} He presented the Declaration as establishing equality as a foundational principle for the United States, which had a significant impact on social and political movements in the US into the 20th century.{{sfn|Jividen|2011|pp=12&amp;ndash;15}}

As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to [[Jacksonian democrats]].{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=196–198, 229–231, 301}} Nevertheless, Lincoln admired [[Andrew Jackson]]'s steeliness and patriotism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Wilentz |first=Sean |author-link=Sean Wilentz |date=2012 |title=Abraham Lincoln and Jacksonian democracy |url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/node/242 |publisher=Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818082649/http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/lincoln/essays/abraham-lincoln-and-jacksonian-democracy |archivedate=August 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the Jacksonian &quot;belief in the common man&quot;.{{sfn|Work|2024|p=8}} According to historian [[Sean Wilentz]], &quot;just as the Republican Party of the 1850s absorbed certain elements of Jacksonianism, so Lincoln, whose Whiggery had always been more egalitarian than that of other Whigs, found himself absorbing some of them as well.&quot;{{sfn|Wilentz|2012}}

[[William C. Harris (historian)|William C. Harris]] found that Lincoln's &quot;reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism.&quot;{{sfn|Harris|2007|p=2}} In Lincoln's first inaugural address, he denounced secession as anarchy and argued that &quot;a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks, and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Belz|1y=1998|1p=86|2a1=Lincoln|2y=1953|2pp=256&amp;ndash;257}}

===Religious skepticism and providence===
{{Further|Religious views of Abraham Lincoln}}
As a young man Lincoln was a [[religious skepticism|religious skeptic]].{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=4|Wilson|1999|2p=84}} However, he was deeply familiar with the [[Bible]];{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=48–49, 514–515}} throughout his public career, he often quoted Scripture.{{sfn|Myers|2018|p=21}} His three most famous speeches—the [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], the [[Gettysburg Address]], and [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|his second inaugural address]]—all contain such quotes. In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the [[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated|Doctrine of Necessity]], a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=48–49}}{{sfn|Guelzo|2009|pp=27&amp;ndash;48}}

After the death of his son Edward in 1850 Lincoln more frequently expressed a dependence on God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parrillo|first=Nicholas|year=2000|title=Lincoln's Calvinist transformation: emancipation and war|journal=Civil War History|volume=46| issue=3|pages=227–253|doi=10.1353/cwh.2000.0073}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never joined a church, although he and his wife frequently attended [[First Presbyterian Church (Springfield, Illinois)|First Presbyterian Church]] in Springfield, Illinois, beginning in 1852.{{sfn|White|2009|p=180}} While president, Lincoln often attended services at the [[New York Avenue Presbyterian Church]] in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Mansfield|2012|pp=125&amp;ndash;126}} The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|pp=251–254}} 

Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Protestants.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=27–55}} Sources differ in how they describe his religious beliefs. His law partner [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] gave a lecture after Lincioln's death stating that he was an &quot;unbeliever&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/uip/jala/article/35/2/18/393982|last=Carwardine|first=Richard|title='Simply a theist': Herndon on Lincoln's religion|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|year=2014|volume= 35 |number=2|pages= 18–36|doi=10.5406/19457987.35.2.04}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Smith, the pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Springfield, responded to this lecture with an open letter asserting that Lincoln &quot;did avow his belief in the Divine

==Health and appearance==
{{Main|Health of Abraham Lincoln}}
According to Michael Burlingame, Lincoln was described as &quot;awkward&quot; and &quot;gawky&quot; as a youth.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 41&amp;ndash;42}} In adolescence he was tall and strong, participating in jumping, throwing, wrestling, and footraces, and demonstrating exceptional strength.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 pp. 33, 41}} Burlingame notes that Lincoln's clothes &quot;were typically rough and suited to the frontier&quot;, with a gap between his shoes, socks, and pants that often exposed six or more inches of his shin; &quot;he cared little about fashion&quot;.{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 41}}

Lincoln was a slender six feet four inches,{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 1 p. 41}} with a high-pitched voice.{{sfn|Braden|1993|p=99}} While he is usually portrayed bearded, he did not grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old [[Grace Bedell]]; he was the first U.S. president to do so.{{sfn|Collea|2018|pp=13–14}} [[William H. Herndon]] described Lincoln's face as &quot;long, narrow, sallow, and cadaverous&quot;, his cheeks as &quot;leathery and [[Saffron (color)|saffron-colored]]&quot;.{{sfn|Neely|Holzer|2006|p=35}} Lincoln described himself as having a &quot;dark complexion, with coarse black hair&quot;.{{sfn|Neely|Holzer|2006|p=35}} Lincoln's detractors also remarked on his appearance. For example, the [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] ''Mercury'' described him as having &quot;the dirtiest complexion&quot; and asked &quot;Faugh! after him what decent white man would be President?&quot;{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=96}}

Among the illnesses that Lincoln is either documented or speculated to have suffered from are depression,&lt;ref name=Atlanticoct2005/&gt; [[smallpox]],{{sfn|Burlingame|2008|loc=vol. 2 p. 578}} and [[malaria]].{{sfn|Bollet|2004|p=36}} He took [[blue mass]] pills, which contained [[mercury (element)|mercury]], to treat [[depression (mood)|melancholy]] or [[hypochondriasis]]; this may have resulted in [[mercury poisoning]].&lt;ref name=mercury&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hirschhorn |first1=Norbert |last2=Feldman |first2=Robert G. |last3=Greaves |first3=Ian |date=Summer 2001 |title=Abraham Lincoln's blue pills: did our 16th president suffer from mercury poisoning? |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/26064 |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=315–322 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2001.0048 |pmid=11482002|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several claims have been made that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination, as [[list of photographs of Abraham Lincoln|photographs of Lincoln]] appear to show weight loss and facial changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic.com&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Kent|2022|p=240}} It has been proposed that he could have had a rare genetic disorder such as [[Marfan syndrome]] or [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic.com&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Abraham|last=Verghese|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/05/was-lincoln-dying-before-he-was-shot/17955/ |title=Was Lincoln dying before he was shot? |magazine=The Atlantic |date=May 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145051/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/05/was-lincoln-dying-before-he-was-shot/17955/ |archivedate=April 13, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnm|Kent|2022|1p=240|Schroeder-Lein|2012|2pp=39&amp;ndash;40}}

Lincoln's assassination made him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln to be a man of outstanding ability.{{sfn|Chesebrough|1994|pp=76, 79, 106, 110}} In the [[New Deal]] era, liberals honored Lincoln as an advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the [[welfare state]],{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=23, 91–98}} and Lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world.{{sfn|Carwardine|Sexton|2011|pp=7, 9–10, 54}} Sociologist [[Barry Schwartz (sociologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, Lincoln provided the nation with &quot;a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life.&quot;{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=xi, 9, 24}} Schwartz states that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920s), when he emerged as one of America's most venerated heroes, even among White Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Schwartz|2000|p=109}} However, Schwartz also argued in 2008 that since World War II Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this &quot;fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.&quot;{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|pp=xi, 9}} By the 1970s, Lincoln had become a hero to [[Conservatism in the United States|political conservatives]]{{sfn|Havers|2009|p=96}}—apart from [[neo-Confederates]] such as [[Mel Bradford]], who denounced his treatment of the White South—for his nationalism, his support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery, and his perceived devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.{{sfnm|Belz|2014|1pp=514–518|Graebner|1959|2pp=67–94|Smith|2010|3pp=43–45}}

Lincoln has also been extensively portrayed in film. Early works attempted to mythologize him, emphasizing his mercifulness, as in ''[[Abraham Lincoln's Clemency]]'' (1910). Works from the [[Great Depression]] era emphasized his early struggles and folksiness, as in ''[[Young Mr. Lincoln]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name=stokes&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14664658.2011.594651|title=Abraham Lincoln and the movies|last=Stokes|first=Melvyn|date=2011|pages=203&amp;ndash;231|journal=American Nineteenth Century History|volume=12|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a marked decrease in film portrayals between 1941 and 1999,&lt;ref name=stokes/&gt; [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal in ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'', a 2012 [[Biographical film|biographical]] film directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Whipp|first1=Glenn|date=February 24, 2013|title= Oscars 2013: Daniel Day-Lewis wins best actor for 'Lincoln'|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-xpm-2013-feb-24-la-et-mn-oscars-2013-daniel-day-lewis-wins-lead-actor-lincoln-20130220-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
